It works by promoting the division and differentiation of committed erythroid progenitors in the bone marrow [FDA Label]. Epoetin alfa (Epoge) was developed by Amgen Inc. in 1983 as the first rhEPO commercialized in the United States, followed by other alfa and beta formulations. Epoetin alfa is a 165-amino acid erythropoiesis-stimulating glycoprotein produced in cell culture using recombinant DNA technology and is used for the treatment of patients with anemia associated with various clinical conditions, such as chronic renal failure, antiviral drug therapy, chemotherapy, or a high risk for perioperative blood loss from surgical procedures [FDA Label]. It has a molecular weight of approximately 30,400 daltons and is produced by mammalian cells into which the human erythropoietin gene has been introduced. The product contains the identical amino acid sequence of isolated natural erythropoietin and has the same biological activity as the endogenous erythropoietin. Epoetin alfa biosimilar, such as Retacrit (epoetin alfa-epbx or epoetin zeta), has been formulated to allow more access to treatment options for patients in the market [L2784]. The biosimilar is approved by the FDA and EMA as a safe, effective and affordable biological product and displays equivalent clinical efficacy, potency, and purity to the reference product [A7504]. Epoetin alfa formulations can be administered intravenously or subcutaneously.\nDB00019\tPegfilgrastim\tbiotech\t[\u0027approved\u0027]\t[\u0027L03AA13\u0027]\t[\u0027Adjuvants, Immunologic\u0027, \u0027Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins\u0027, \u0027Antineoplastic and Immunomodulating Agents\u0027, \u0027Biological Factors\u0027, \u0027Carbohydrates\u0027, \u0027Colony-Stimulating Factors\u0027, \u0027Cytokines\u0027, \u0027Glycoconjugates\u0027, \u0027Glycoproteins\u0027, \u0027Hematinics\u0027, \u0027Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors\u0027, \u0027Increased Myeloid Cell Production\u0027, \u0027Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins\u0027, \u0027Leukocyte Growth Factor\u0027, \u0027Peptides\u0027, \u0027Proteins\u0027]\tPegfilgrastim is a modified form of filgrastim which has been PEGylated at the N terminus.

HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) resulting in less use of Peginterferon alfa-2b. Peginterferon alfa-2b is derived from the alfa-2b moeity of recombinant human interferon and acts by binding to human type 1 interferon receptors. Activation and dimerization of this receptor induces the body\u0027s innate antiviral response by activating the janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway. Use of Peginterferon alfa-2b is associated with a wide range of severe adverse effects including the aggravation and development of endocrine and autoimmune disorders, retinopathies, cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric complications, and increased risk of hepatic decompensation in patients with cirrhosis. The use of Peginterferon alfa-2b has largely declined since newer interferon-free antiviral therapies have been developed.\r\n\r\nIn a joint recommendation published in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) no longer recommend Peginterferon alfa-2b for the treatment of Hepatitis C [A19593]. Peginterferon alfa-2b was used alongside [DB00811] with the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 48 weeks of therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626].\r\n\r\nPeginterferon alfa-2b is available as a variable dose injectable product (tradename Pegintron) used for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis C. Approved in 2001 by the FDA, Pegintron is indicated for the treatment of HCV with [Ribavirin] or other antiviral drugs [FDA Label]. When combined together, Peginterferon alfa-2b and [Ribavirin] have been shown to achieve a SVR between 41% for genotype 1 and 75% for genotypes 2-6 after 48 weeks of treatment.\nDB00026\tAnakinra\tbiotech\t[\u0027approved\u0027]\t[\u0027L04AC03\u0027]\t[\u0027Agents reducing cytokine levels\u0027, \u0027Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins\u0027, \u0027Antineoplastic and Immunomodulating Agents\u0027, \u0027Biological Factors\u0027, \u0027Biologics for Rheumatoid Arthritis Treatment\u0027, \u0027Cytokines\u0027, \u0027Disease-modifying Antirheumatic Agents\u0027, \u0027Immunosuppressive Agents\u0027, \u0027Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins\u0027, \u0027Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonists\u0027, \u0027Interleukin Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027Interleukin-1 Receptor Antagonist\u0027, \u0027Peptides\u0027, \u0027Proteins\u0027]\tAnakinra is a recombinant, nonglycosylated human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra).

ADH is an endogenous pituitary hormone that has a crucial role in the control of the water content in the body. Upon release from the stimulation of increased plasma osmolarity or decreased circulating blood volume, ADH mainly acts on the cells of the distal part of the nephron and the collecting tubules in the kidney [T28]. The hormone interacts with V1, V2 or V3 receptors with differing signal cascade systems.\r\n\r\nDesmopressin displays enhanced antidiuretic potency, fewer pressor effects due to V2-selective actions, and a prolonged half-life and duration of action compared to endogenous ADH [A31661]. It has been employed clinically since 1972 and is available in various formulations including intranasal solution, intravenous solution, oral tablet and oral lyophilisate [A31662]. Desmopressin is indicated for the treatment of polyuric conditions including primary nocturnal enuresis, nocturia, and diabetes insipidus. It was also newly approved for the treatment of mild classical hemophilia and von Willebrand\u0027s disease for minor surgeries. The active ingredient in most formulations is desmopressin acetate. Nocdurna, or desmopressin acetate, was approved by the FDA on June 21st, 2018 for the treatment of nocturia due to nocturnal polyuria in adults.

Albumin represents approximately 50% of the total protein content in healthy humans [A40060].\r\n\r\nHuman albumin is a small globular protein (molecular weight: 66.5 kDa), consisting of a single chain of 585 amino acids organized in three repeated homolog domains (sites I, II, and III). Each domain comprises two separate sub-domains (A and B) [A40060]. \r\n\r\nThere are various preparations of albumin that are well established and widely available in the clinical setting [L3108], [L3109], [L3101].\r\n\r\nAlso known as _Albuminex_ 5% or 25%, one brand of human serum albumin is prepared from the pooled plasma of US donors in FDA-licensed facilities in the US [F229].

Infliximab is produced by a recombinant cell line cultured by continuous perfusion. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) is a key proinflammatory cytokine involved in chronic inflammatory diseases [A31469]. Its hyperactivity and enhanced signalling pathways can be observed in inflammatory diseases where it activates further pro-inflammatory cascades. By binding to both the soluble subunit and the membrane-bound precursor of TNF-α [A106], infliximab disrupts the interaction of TNF-α with its receptors and may also cause lysis of cells that produce TNF-α [A106].\r\n\r\nInfliximab was first approved by the FDA in 1998 under the market name Remicade as an intravenous injection. It is indicated for the treatment of various inflammatory disorders such as adult or pediatric Chron\u0027s disease, adult or pediatric ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis in combination with methotrexate, ankylosing spondyliti, psoriatic arthritis, and plaque psoriasis [FDA Label]. In clinical trials, multiple infusions of infliximab displayed in a reduction of signs and symptoms of inflammatory diseases and induction of remission in patients who have had an inadequate response to alternative first-line therapies for that disorder [ FDA Label]. \r\n\r\nThere are currently two biosilimars of infliximab available in the US market that demonstrate a high degree of similarity to the reference product, Remicade.

The alpha- and beta- subunits have 92 and 111 amino acids. The alpha subunit is glycosylated at Asn 51 and Asn 78 while the beta subunit is glycosylated at Asn 7 and Asn 24. Follitropin beta is produced in genetically engineered Chinese hamster cell lines (CHO). The nomenclature “beta” differentiates it from another recombinant human FSH product that was marketed earlier as follitropin alpha. Follitropin is important in the development of follicles produced by the ovaries. Given by subcutaneous injection, it is used in combination with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to assist in ovulation and fertility. Follitropin may also be used to cause the ovary to produce several follicles, which can then be harvested for use in gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT) or in vitro fertilization (IVF).  Numerous physio-chemical tests and bioassays indicate that follitropin beta and follitropin alpha are indistinguishable. However, a more recent study showed there is may be a slight clinical difference, with the alpha form tending towards a higher pregnancy rate and the beta form tending towards a lower pregnancy rate, but with significantly higher estradiol (E2) levels. Structural analysis shows that the amino acid sequence of follitropin beta is identical to that of natural human follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). Further, the ogliosaccharide side chains are very similar, but not completely identical to that of natural FSH. However, these small differences do not affect the bioactivity compared to natural FSH.\nDB00067\tVasopressin\tsmall molecule\t[\u0027approved\u0027]\t[\u0027H01BA06\u0027, \u0027H01BA01\u0027]\t[\u0027Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins\u0027, \u0027Antidiuretic Agents\u0027, \u0027Cardiovascular Agents\u0027, \u0027Coagulants\u0027, \u0027Hematologic Agents\u0027, \u0027Hemostatics\u0027, \u0027Hormones\u0027, \u0027Hormones, Hormone Substitutes, and Hormone Antagonists\u0027, \u0027Natriuretic Agents\u0027, \u0027Nerve Tissue Proteins\u0027, \u0027Neuropeptides\u0027, \u0027Oligopeptides\u0027, \u0027Peptide Hormones\u0027, \u0027Peptides\u0027, \u0027Pituitary\u0027, \u0027Pituitary and Hypothalamic Hormones and Analogues\u0027, \u0027Pituitary Hormones\u0027, \u0027Pituitary Hormones, Posterior\u0027, \u0027Posterior Pituitary Lobe Hormones\u0027, \u0027Proteins\u0027, \u0027Systemic Hormonal Preparations, Excl.

In spite of structural differences between compounds in this class, the SSRIs possess similar pharmacological activity. As with other antidepressant agents, several weeks of therapy may be indicated before a clinical effect is noticed. SSRIs are potent inhibitors of serotonin reuptake in the neurons. They have little to no effect on norepinephrine or dopamine reuptake and do not antagonize \u0026alpha;- or \u0026beta;-adrenergic, dopamine D\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003e or histamine H\u003csub\u003e1\u003c/sub\u003e receptors. During acute usage, SSRIs inhibit serotonin reuptake and increase serotonin stimulation of somatodendritic 5-HT\u003csub\u003e1A\u003c/sub\u003e and terminal autoreceptors. Chronic use leads to desensitization of somatodendritic 5-HT\u003csub\u003e1A\u003c/sub\u003e and terminal autoreceptors. The general clinical effect of increased mood and decreased anxiety is thought to be due to adaptive changes in neuronal function that leads to enhanced serotonergic neurotransmission. Side effects include dry mouth, nausea, dizziness, drowsiness, sexual dysfunction, and headache. Side effects generally occur within the first two weeks of therapy and are usually less severe and frequent than those observed with tricyclic antidepressants. Citalopram is approved for treatment of depression. Unlabeled indications include mild dementia-associated agitation in nonpsychotic patients, smoking cessation, ethanol abuse, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in children, and diabetic neuropathy [A325, FDA label].\nDB00217\tBethanidine\tsmall molecule\t[\u0027approved\u0027]\t[\u0027C02CC01\u0027]\t[\u0027Adrenergic Agents\u0027, \u0027Adrenergic Agonists\u0027, \u0027Adrenergic alpha-2 Receptor Agonists\u0027, \u0027Adrenergic alpha-Agonists\u0027, \u0027Agents producing tachycardia\u0027, \u0027Agents that produce hypertension\u0027, \u0027Amidines\u0027, \u0027Antiadrenergic Agents, Peripherally Acting\u0027, \u0027Antihypertensive Agents\u0027, \u0027Autonomic Agents\u0027, \u0027Cardiovascular Agents\u0027, \u0027Guanidine Derivatives\u0027, \u0027Guanidines\u0027, \u0027Neurotransmitter Agents\u0027, \u0027Peripheral Nervous System Agents\u0027, \u0027Sympatholytics\u0027]\tA guanidinium antihypertensive agent that acts by blocking adrenergic transmission.\nDB00219\tOxyphenonium\tsmall molecule\t[\u0027approved\u0027]\t[\u0027A03AB53\u0027, \u0027A03AB03\u0027]\t[\u0027Agents producing tachycardia\u0027, \u0027Alimentary Tract and Metabolism\u0027, \u0027Amines\u0027, \u0027Ammonium Compounds\u0027, \u0027Anticholinergic Agents\u0027, \u0027Autonomic Agents\u0027, \u0027Cholinergic Agents\u0027, \u0027Drugs for Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders\u0027, \u0027Muscarinic Antagonists\u0027, \u0027Mydriatics\u0027, \u0027Neurotransmitter Agents\u0027, \u0027Nitrogen Compounds\u0027, \u0027Onium Compounds\u0027, \u0027Parasympatholytics\u0027, \u0027Peripheral Nervous System Agents\u0027, \u0027Quaternary Ammonium Compounds\u0027, \u0027Synthetic Anticholinergics, Quaternary Ammonium Compounds\u0027]\tA quaternary ammonium anticholinergic agent with peripheral side effects similar to those of atropine.

It may also be used to treat extrapyramidal reactions, such as dystonia and Parkinsonism, caused by antipsychotics (e.g. phenothiazines). Symptoms of Parkinson’s disease and extrapyramidal reactions arise from decreases in dopaminergic activity which creates an imbalance between dopaminergic and cholinergic activity. Anticholinergic therapy is thought to aid in restoring this balance leading to relief of symptoms. In addition to its anticholinergic effects, benztropine also inhibits the reuptake of dopamine at nerve terminals via the dopamine transporter.

Venlafaxine was the sixth most widely-used antidepressant based on the amount of retail prescriptions in the US (17.1 million) in 2006.\nDB00286\tConjugated estrogens\tsmall molecule\t[\u0027approved\u0027]\t[\u0027G03CC07\u0027, \u0027G03CA57\u0027]\t[\u0027Agents causing angioedema\u0027, \u0027BCRP/ABCG2 Substrates\u0027, \u0027COMT Substrates\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inhibitors (weak)\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Substrates\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027Estradiol Congeners\u0027, \u0027Estrogens\u0027, \u0027Genito Urinary System and Sex Hormones\u0027, \u0027Gonadal Hormones\u0027, \u0027Gonadal Steroid Hormones\u0027, \u0027Hormones\u0027, \u0027Hormones, Hormone Substitutes, and Hormone Antagonists\u0027, \u0027Natural and Semisynthetic Estrogens, Plain\u0027, \u0027OAT3/SLC22A8 Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027OAT3/SLC22A8 Substrates\u0027, \u0027OATP1B1/SLCO1B1 Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027OATP1B1/SLCO1B1 Substrates\u0027, \u0027OATP1B3 substrates\u0027, \u0027P-glycoprotein/ABCB1 Substrates\u0027, \u0027Sex Hormones and Modulators of the Genital System\u0027]\tConjugated estrogens, or Conjugated Equine Estrogens (CEEs) are composed of a mixture of the water-soluble salts of sulfate esters from estrone, equilin, 17 α-dihydroequilin, and other related steroids that are purified from pregnant horse urine. Available as the product Premarin (FDA), this combination of equine-derived estrogenic compounds is indicated for the following conditions: treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms and vulvovaginal atrophy associated with menopause; hypoestrogenism due to hypogonadism, castration or primary ovarian failure; palliation of metastatic breast cancer; palliation of advanced androgen-dependent carcinoma of the prostate; and for prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis.\r\n\r\nAll estrogen products mimic the effects of endogenous estrogens in the body which are responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Estrogens act by binding to estrogen receptors on a wide variety of tissues in the body and modulating the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) through a negative feedback mechanism. Prior to menopause, the primary source of estrogen is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70-500 micrograms of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. However, once a woman stops ovulating there is a sharp decline in the production of progesterone and estradiol by the ovaries and a consequent fluctuation in LH and FSH due to a lack of feedback control. This shift in hormone production is largely responsible for many of the symptoms experienced during and after menopause and includes hot flashes and other vasomotor symptoms, painful intercourse, vaginal dryness, and vulvovaginal atrophy. These symptoms are able to be reduced by replacing many of the hormones lost during and following menopause with synthetic or naturally occurring forms, in a therapy known as Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT).\r\n\r\nPharmacologic estrogen products are available in a variety of formats. Although many of them contain several compounds in common (such as the estrogen derivatives sodium estrone sulfate and sodium equilin sulfate), they vary by their original source (such as horse-, human-, or plant-derived), and the remaining mixture of estrogenic derivatives. Conjugated Equine Estrogens (CEEs) are derived from the urine of pregnant mares and contain a blend of at least 10 estrogen derivatives. Marketed under the brand name Premarin, CEEs are the most frequently used form of conjugated estrogens. There is currently no generic form of CEEs available as a detailed analytical characterization of the active ingredients or of their estrogenic activity is not available at this time. Conjugated estrogens are also available in a plant-derived synthetic form that replicates the naturally occurring, horse-derived forms. Available as either \"Synthetic Conjugated Estrogens, A\" containing 9 estrogen derivatives (available as Cenestin) or as \"Synthetic Conjugated Estrogens, B\" containing 10 estrogen derivatives (available as Enjuvia), these products are isolated as precursors from yam or soy plants and then chemically modified to mimic the products available in their naturally occurring form.\nDB00287\tTravoprost\tsmall molecule\t[\u0027approved\u0027]\t[\u0027S01EE04\u0027]\t[\u0027Antiglaucoma Preparations and Miotics\u0027, \u0027Antihypertensive Agents\u0027, \u0027Autacoids\u0027, \u0027Biological Factors\u0027, \u0027Cardiovascular Agents\u0027, \u0027Cloprostenol\u0027, \u0027Eicosanoids\u0027, \u0027Fatty Acids\u0027, \u0027Fatty Acids, Unsaturated\u0027, \u0027Inflammation Mediators\u0027, \u0027Lipids\u0027, \u0027Ophthalmics\u0027, \u0027Ophthalmologicals\u0027, \u0027Prostaglandins\u0027, \u0027Prostaglandins F, Synthetic\u0027, \u0027Prostaglandins, Synthetic\u0027, \u0027Sensory Organs\u0027]\tTravoprost ophthalmic solution is a topical medication used for controlling the progression of glaucoma or ocular hypertension, by reducing intraocular pressure.

TCAs are structurally similar to phenothiazines. They contain a tricyclic ring system with an alkyl amine substituent on the central ring. In non-depressed individuals, amitriptyline does not affect mood or arousal, but may cause sedation. In depressed individuals, amitriptyline exerts a positive effect on mood. TCAs are potent inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Tertiary amine TCAs, such as amitriptyline, are more potent inhibitors of serotonin reuptake than secondary amine TCAs, such as nortriptyline. TCAs also down-regulate cerebral cortical \u0026beta;-adrenergic receptors and sensitize post-synaptic serotonergic receptors with chronic use. The antidepressant effects of TCAs are thought to be due to an overall increase in serotonergic neurotransmission. TCAs also block histamine-H\u003csub\u003e1\u003c/sub\u003e receptors, \u0026alpha;\u003csub\u003e1\u003c/sub\u003e-adrenergic receptors and muscarinic receptors, which accounts for their sedative, hypotensive and anticholinergic effects (e.g. blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention), respectively. Amitriptyline may be used to treat depression, chronic pain (unlabeled use), irritable bowel syndrome (unlabeled use), diabetic neuropathy (unlabeled use), post-traumatic stress disorder (unlabeled use), and for migraine prophylaxis (unlabeled use).\nDB00322\tFloxuridine\tsmall molecule\t[\u0027approved\u0027]\t[]\t[\u0027Antimetabolites\u0027, \u0027Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic\u0027, \u0027Antineoplastic Agents\u0027, \u0027Carbohydrates\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Inhibitors (strong)\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027Deoxyribonucleosides\u0027, \u0027Deoxyuridine\u0027, \u0027Glycosides\u0027, \u0027Immunosuppressive Agents\u0027, \u0027Myelosuppressive Agents\u0027, \u0027Noxae\u0027, \u0027Nucleic Acids, Nucleotides, and Nucleosides\u0027, \u0027Nucleosides\u0027, \u0027Pyrimidine Nucleosides\u0027, \u0027Pyrimidines\u0027, \u0027Ribonucleosides\u0027, \u0027Toxic Actions\u0027, \u0027Uridine\u0027]\tAn antineoplastic antimetabolite that is metabolized to fluorouracil when administered by rapid injection.

TCAs are structurally similar to phenothiazines. They contain a tricyclic ring system with an alkyl amine substituent on the central ring. In non-depressed individuals, protriptyline does not affect mood or arousal, but may cause sedation. In depressed individuals, protriptyline exerts a positive effect on mood. TCAs are potent inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. In addition, TCAs down-regulate cerebral cortical \u0026beta;-adrenergic receptors and sensitize post-synaptic serotonergic receptors with chronic use. The antidepressant effects of TCAs are thought to be due to an overall increase in serotonergic neurotransmission. TCAs also block histamine H\u003csub\u003e1\u003c/sub\u003e receptors, \u0026alpha;\u003csub\u003e1\u003c/sub\u003e-adrenergic receptors and muscarinic receptors, which accounts for their sedative, hypotensive and anticholinergic effects (e.g. blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention), respectively.

It acts primarily on vascular smooth muscle cells by stabilizing voltage-gated L-type calcium channels in their inactive conformation. By inhibiting the influx of calcium in smooth muscle cells, amlodipine prevents calcium-dependent myocyte contraction and vasoconstriction. A second proposed mechanism for the drug’s vasodilatory effects involves pH-dependent inhibition of calcium influx via inhibition of smooth muscle carbonic anhydrase. Some studies have shown that amlodipine also exerts inhibitory effects on voltage-gated N-type calcium channels. N-type calcium channels located in the central nervous system may be involved in nociceptive signaling and pain sensation.

TCAs are structurally similar to phenothiazines. They contain a tricyclic ring system with an alkyl amine substituent on the central ring. In non-depressed individuals, imipramine does not affect mood or arousal, but may cause sedation. In depressed individuals, imipramine exerts a positive effect on mood. TCAs are potent inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Tertiary amine TCAs, such as imipramine and amitriptyline, are more potent inhibitors of serotonin reuptake than secondary amine TCAs, such as nortriptyline and desipramine. TCAs also block histamine H\u003csub\u003e1\u003c/sub\u003e receptors, \u0026alpha;\u003csub\u003e1\u003c/sub\u003e-adrenergic receptors and muscarinic receptors, which accounts for their sedative, hypotensive and anticholinergic effects (e.g. blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention), respectively [A6584]. Imipramine has less sedative and anticholinergic effects than the tertiary amine TCAs, amitriptyline and clomipramine. Imipramine may be used to treat depression and nocturnal enuresis in children [FDA Label]. Unlabeled indications include chronic and neuropathic pain (including diabetic neuropathy), panic disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [L1349,L1348,A31900,L1351,L1352,L1353,A31904].\nDB00459\tAcitretin\tsmall molecule\t[\u0027approved\u0027]\t[\u0027D05BB02\u0027]\t[\u0027Alkenes\u0027, \u0027Antipsoriatics\u0027, \u0027Antipsoriatics for Systemic Use\u0027, \u0027Biological Factors\u0027, \u0027Carotenoids\u0027, \u0027Cyclohexanes\u0027, \u0027Cyclohexenes\u0027, \u0027Cycloparaffins\u0027, \u0027Dermatologicals\u0027, \u0027Hydrocarbons, Acyclic\u0027, \u0027Keratolytic Agents\u0027, \u0027Misc.

It was used commonly and as a bitter and flavoring agent, and is still useful for the treatment of babesiosis. Quinine is also useful in some muscular disorders, especially nocturnal leg cramps and myotonia congenita, because of its direct effects on muscle membrane and sodium channels.

It is usually administered orally. Montelukast blocks the action of leukotriene D4 on the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor CysLT1 in the lungs and bronchial tubes by binding to it. This reduces the bronchoconstriction otherwise caused by the leukotriene, and results in less inflammation. Because of its method of operation, it is not useful for the treatment of acute asthma attacks. Again because of its very specific locus of operation, it does not interact with other allergy medications such as theophylline. Montelukast is marketed in United States and many other countries by Merck \u0026amp; Co. with the brand name Singulair®. It is available as oral tablets, chewable tablets, and oral granules.

TCAs are structurally similar to phenothiazines. They contain a tricyclic ring system with an alkyl amine substituent on the central ring. In non-depressed individuals, nortriptyline does not affect mood or arousal, but may cause sedation. In depressed individuals, nortriptyline exerts a positive effect on mood. TCAs are potent inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Secondary amine TCAs, such as nortriptyline, are more potent inhibitors of norepinephrine reuptake than tertiary amine TCAs, such as amitriptyline. TCAs also down-regulate cerebral cortical \u0026beta;-adrenergic receptors and sensitize post-synaptic serotonergic receptors with chronic use. The antidepressant effects of TCAs are thought to be due to an overall increase in serotonergic neurotransmission. TCAs also block histamine-H\u003csub\u003e1\u003c/sub\u003e receptors, \u0026alpha;\u003csub\u003e1\u003c/sub\u003e-adrenergic receptors and muscarinic receptors, which accounts for their sedative, hypotensive and anticholinergic effects (e.g. blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention), respectively. Compared to other TCAs, nortriptyline is less toxic and displays less drug interactions [A6584]. As a more selective noadrenaline reuptake inhibitor, nortriptyline is less likely associated with the hypertensive ‘cheese reaction\u0027 [A6584]. Nortriptyline exerts less anticholinergic and sedative side effects compared to the tertiary amine TCAs, amitriptyline and clomipramine. Apart from its indication to treat depression, nortriptyline has been investigated in chronic neuropathic pain (unlabeled use), fibromyalgia [A31911], irritable bowel syndrome (unlabeled use), diabetic neuropathy (unlabeled use) [A31912], post-traumatic stress disorder (unlabeled use), and migraine prophylaxis (unlabeled use).\nDB00543\tAmoxapine\tsmall molecule\t[\u0027approved\u0027]\t[\u0027N06AA17\u0027]\t[\u0027Adrenergic Agents\u0027, \u0027Adrenergic alpha-1 Receptor Antagonists\u0027, \u0027Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists\u0027, \u0027Adrenergic Antagonists\u0027, \u0027Adrenergic Uptake Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027Agents producing tachycardia\u0027, \u0027Agents that produce hypertension\u0027, \u0027Agents that reduce seizure threshold\u0027, \u0027Anticholinergic Agents\u0027, \u0027Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation\u0027, \u0027Antidepressive Agents, Tetracyclic\u0027, \u0027Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic\u0027, \u0027Antipsychotic Agents\u0027, \u0027Central Nervous System Agents\u0027, \u0027Central Nervous System Depressants\u0027, \u0027Combined Inhibitors of Serotonin/Norepinephrine Reuptake\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Substrates\u0027, \u0027Dibenzoxazepines\u0027, \u0027Dopamine Agents\u0027, \u0027Dopamine Antagonists\u0027, \u0027Dopamine D2 Receptor Antagonists\u0027, \u0027Histamine Antagonists\u0027, \u0027Histamine H1 Antagonists\u0027, \u0027Membrane Transport Modulators\u0027, \u0027Muscarinic Antagonists\u0027, \u0027Narrow Therapeutic Index Drugs\u0027, \u0027Nervous System\u0027, \u0027Neurotoxic agents\u0027, \u0027Neurotransmitter Agents\u0027, \u0027Neurotransmitter Uptake Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027Non-Selective Monoamine Reuptake Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027P-glycoprotein/ABCB1 Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027Potential QTc-Prolonging Agents\u0027, \u0027Psychoanaleptics\u0027, \u0027Psychotropic Drugs\u0027, \u0027QTc Prolonging Agents\u0027, \u0027Serotonergic Drugs Shown to Increase Risk of Serotonin Syndrome\u0027, \u0027Serotonin 5-HT1 Receptor Antagonists\u0027, \u0027Serotonin 5-HT2 Receptor Antagonists\u0027, \u0027Serotonin Agents\u0027, \u0027Serotonin Modulators\u0027, \u0027Serotonin Receptor Antagonists\u0027]\tAmoxapine, the \u003ci\u003eN\u003c/i\u003e-demethylated derivative of the antipsychotic agent loxapine, is a dibenzoxazepine-derivative tricyclic antidepressant (TCA).

Thiazides like cyclothiazide also inhibit sodium ion transport across the renal tubular epithelium through binding to the thiazide sensitive sodium-chloride transporter. This results in an increase in potassium excretion via the sodium-potassium exchange mechanism. The antihypertensive mechanism of cyclothiazide is less well understood although it may be mediated through its action on carbonic anhydrases in the smooth muscle or through its action on the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (KCa) channel, also found in the smooth muscle. Cyclothiazide is indicated as adjunctive therapy in edema associated with congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, and corticosteroid and estrogen therapy.

Bisphosphonates were first used to treat Paget’s disease in 1971. This class of medications is comprised of inorganic pyrophosphate analogues that contain non-hydrolyzable P-C-P bonds. Similar to other bisphosphonates, alendronate has a high affinity for bone mineral and is taken up during osteoclast resorption. Alendronate inhibits farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase, one of the enzymes in the mevalonic acid pathway involved in producing isoprenoid compounds that are essential for post-translational modification of small guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins, such as Rho, Ras and Rab. Inhibition of this process interferes with osteoclast function and survival.

Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nDB00651\tDyphylline\tsmall molecule\t[\u0027approved\u0027]\t[\u0027R03DA51\u0027, \u0027R03DA20\u0027, \u0027R03DA01\u0027, \u0027R03DB01\u0027]\t[\u0027Alkaloids\u0027, \u0027Anti-Asthmatic Agents\u0027, \u0027Autonomic Agents\u0027, \u0027Bronchodilator Agents\u0027, \u0027Cardiovascular Agents\u0027, \u0027Drugs for Obstructive Airway Diseases\u0027, \u0027Enzyme Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027Peripheral Nervous System Agents\u0027, \u0027Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027Purines\u0027, \u0027Purinones\u0027, \u0027Respiratory System Agents\u0027, \u0027Vasodilating Agents\u0027, \u0027Xanthine derivatives\u0027, \u0027Xanthines and Adrenergics\u0027]\tA theophylline derivative with broncho- and vasodilator properties.

Additional adverse effects such as necrosis, purple toe syndrome, osteoporosis, valve and artery calcification, and drug interactions have also been documented with warfarin use.

It is primarily indicated for use in treating hepatitis C and viral hemorrhagic fevers. HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. It is reported that ribavirin might be only effective in early stages of viral hemorrhagic fevers including Lasser fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever, and Hantavirus infection. Ribavirin is a prodrug that is metabolized into nucleoside analogs that blocks viral RNA synthesis and viral mRNA capping. Before the development of newer drugs, ribavirin and [DB00008]/[DB00022] dual therapy was considered the first-generation and standard antiviral treatment [A19626]. The dual therapy was administered for 48 weeks in patients with genotype 1, 4, 5, and 6, and 24 weeks in patients with genotype 2 and 3 [A19626]. Newer drugs developed as Hepatitis C viral infection treatments can be used to reduce or eliminate the use of ribavirin, which are associated with serious adverse effects. They also improve therapeutic efficacy in patients with failed [DB00008]/[DB00022] and ribavirin-based therapy. The potential use of ribavirin as a treatment for acute myeloid leukemia is currently under investigation.\r\n\r\nAccording to 2017 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and 2015 consensus guidelines from the Canadian Association for the Study of the Liver (CASL), ribavirin is typically used as an adjunct therapy to various first-line and second-line combination therapies recommended for each genotypes. Ribavirin is added to decrease relapse rates by accelerating viral clearance early in the treatment course [A19645]. When used to treat Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, it is always used as a part of combination therapies as ribavirin monotherapy is not efficacious in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection [A19644]. Additionally, including ribavirin in the regimen can increase the risk of anemia. \r\n\r\nIn HCV genotye 1/2/3/4/5/6 patients, ribavirin can be used in combination therapy involving [DB09102] and [DB08934], Eplusa ([DB08934], [DB11613]), Harvoni ([DB08934], [DB09027]), [DB06290] and [DB08934], Viekira Pak ([DB09296], [DB09297], [DB00503], [DB09183]), Technivie ([DB00503], [DB09296], [DB09297]) and Zepatier ([DB11574], [DB11575]). Addition of weight-based ribavirin to Technivie therapy increased sustained virologic response after 12 weeks of daily therapy (SVR12) from 90% to 97% in patients with HCV genotype 1a and 90.9% to 100% in HCV genotype 4 patients [L852]. Zepatier therapy along with ribavirin improved SVR in HCV genotype 5 patients. Combination therapy of ribavirin and [DB00008] results in the SVR of 44% in patients with genotype 1 infection and 70% in patients with genotype 2-6. The inclusion of ribavirin in the combination therapies depend on individual patient\u0027s profile, for example if HCV genotype 3 patient has a Y93H genetic variant and compensated cirrhosis.\nDB00815\tSodium lauryl sulfate\tsmall molecule\t[\u0027approved\u0027]\t[]\t[\u0027Acids\u0027, \u0027Acids, Noncarboxylic\u0027, \u0027Alcohols\u0027, \u0027Alkanes\u0027, \u0027Alkanesulfonates\u0027, \u0027Alkanesulfonic Acids\u0027, \u0027Dodecanol\u0027, \u0027Fatty Alcohols\u0027, \u0027Hydrocarbons, Acyclic\u0027, \u0027Lipids\u0027, \u0027Sulfones\u0027, \u0027Sulfonic Acids\u0027, \u0027Sulfur Acids\u0027, \u0027Sulfur Compounds\u0027, \u0027Surface-Active Agents\u0027]\tSodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) is an anionic surfactant naturally derived from coconut and/or palm kernel oil.

This is accomplished by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine through reversible inhibition of its hydrolysis by acetylcholinesterase.

Donepezil has been tested in other cognitive disorders including Lewy body dementia and Vascular dementia, but it is not currently approved for these indications.

It is a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5). Penile erection is a hemodynamic process initiated by the relaxation of smooth muscle in the corpus cavernosum and its associated arterioles. During sexual stimulation, nitric oxide is released from nerve endings and endothelial cells in the corpus cavernosum. Nitric oxide activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase resulting in increased synthesis of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in the smooth muscle cells of the corpus cavernosum. The cGMP in turn triggers smooth muscle relaxation, allowing increased blood flow into the penis, resulting in erection. The tissue concentration of cGMP is regulated by both the rates of synthesis and degradation via phosphodiesterases (PDEs). The most abundant PDE in the human corpus cavernosum is the cGMPspecific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5); therefore, the inhibition of PDE5 enhances erectile function by increasing the amount of cGMP.\nDB00863\tRanitidine\tsmall molecule\t[\u0027approved\u0027]\t[\u0027A02BA07\u0027, \u0027A02BA02\u0027]\t[\u0027Acid Reducers\u0027, \u0027Alimentary Tract and Metabolism\u0027, \u0027Anti-Ulcer Agents\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Substrates\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors (weak)\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Substrates\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027Drugs for Acid Related Disorders\u0027, \u0027Drugs for Peptic Ulcer and Gastro-Oesophageal Reflux Disease (Gord)\u0027, \u0027Elements\u0027, \u0027Furans\u0027, \u0027Gastric Acid Lowering Agents\u0027, \u0027Gastrointestinal Agents\u0027, \u0027Histamine Agents\u0027, \u0027Histamine Antagonists\u0027, \u0027Histamine H2 Antagonists\u0027, \u0027Metals\u0027, \u0027Metals, Heavy\u0027, \u0027Neurotransmitter Agents\u0027, \u0027OAT3/SLC22A8 Substrates\u0027, \u0027OCT2 Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027OCT2 Substrates\u0027, \u0027P-glycoprotein/ABCB1 Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027P-glycoprotein/ABCB1 Substrates\u0027]\tA non-imidazole blocker of those histamine receptors that mediate gastric secretion (H2 receptors).

The discovery and research of this drug began in the early 1990\u0027s, where intravenous administration of radio-labelled compound in rats resulting in subsequent localization of the drug within enterocytes at the intestinal villus, leading to studies of investigating the effect of ezetimibe on intestinal cholesterol absorption [A15202]. Ezetimibe is used as an adjunctive therapy to diet to lower cholesterol levels in primary hyperlipidemia, mixed hyperlipidemia, homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), and homozygous sitosterolemia (phytosterolemia) [FDA Label].\r\n\r\nUnlike other classes of cholesterol-reducing compounds including statins and bile acid sequestrants, ezetimibe has a distinct mechanism of action involving the sterol transporter Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1), and is the first drug that does not affect absorption of fat-soluble nutrients such as fat-soluble vitamins, triglycerides, or bile acids [A33313]. In genetically NPC1L1-deficient mice, a 70% reduction in intestinal cholesterol absorption was seen and the mice were insensitive to ezetimibe treatment [A15202]. Based on these findings, it is indicated that NPC1L1 plays an essential role in promoting intestinal cholesterol uptake via an ezetimibe-sensitive pathway [A15202]. By interfering with the intestinal uptake of cholesterol and phytosterols, ezetimibe reduces the delivery of intestinal cholesterol to the liver [FDA Label].\nDB00975\tDipyridamole\tsmall molecule\t[\u0027approved\u0027]\t[\u0027B01AC07\u0027]\t[\u0027Anticoagulants\u0027, \u0027Antiplatelet agents\u0027, \u0027Blood and Blood Forming Organs\u0027, \u0027BSEP/ABCB11 Substrates\u0027, \u0027Cardiovascular Agents\u0027, \u0027Decreased Platelet Aggregation\u0027, \u0027Enzyme Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027Hematologic Agents\u0027, \u0027Hypotensive Agents\u0027, \u0027Miscellaneous Vasodilatating Agents\u0027, \u0027OATP1B1/SLCO1B1 Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027OATP1B3 inhibitors\u0027, \u0027P-glycoprotein/ABCB1 Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027P-glycoprotein/ABCB1 Substrates\u0027, \u0027Phosphodiesterase 5 Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors Excl.

Ketolides have been recently added to the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin class of antibiotics. Similar to the macrolide antibiotics, telithromycin prevents bacterial growth by interfering with bacterial protein synthesis. Telithromycin binds to the 50S subunit of the 70S bacterial ribosome and blocks further peptide elongation. Binding occurs simultaneously at to two domains of 23S RNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit, domain II and V, where older macrolides bind only to one.

It belongs to the sulfonylurea class of insulin secretagogues, which act by stimulating \u0026beta; cells of the pancreas to release insulin. Sulfonylureas increase both basal insulin secretion and meal-stimulated insulin release. Medications in this class differ in their dose, rate of absorption, duration of action, route of elimination and binding site on their target pancreatic \u0026beta; cell receptor. Sulfonylureas also increase peripheral glucose utilization, decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis and may increase the number and sensitivity of insulin receptors. Sulfonylureas are associated with weight gain, though less so than insulin. Due to their mechanism of action, sulfonylureas may cause hypoglycemia and require consistent food intake to decrease this risk. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased in elderly, debilitated and malnourished individuals. Glyburide has been shown to decrease fasting plasma glucose, postprandial blood glucose and glycosolated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels (reflective of the last 8-10 weeks of glucose control). Glyburide appears to be completely metabolized, likely in the liver. Although its metabolites exert a small hypoglycemic effect, their contribution to glyburide\u0027s hypoglycemic effect is thought to be clinically unimportant. Glyburide metabolites are excreted in urine and feces in approximately equal proportions.\nDB01019\tBethanechol\tsmall molecule\t[\u0027approved\u0027]\t[\u0027N07AB02\u0027]\t[\u0027Amines\u0027, \u0027Ammonium Compounds\u0027, \u0027Autonomic Agents\u0027, \u0027Bethanechol Compounds\u0027, \u0027Choline Esters\u0027, \u0027Cholinergic Agents\u0027, \u0027Cholinergic Agonists\u0027, \u0027Muscarinic Agonists\u0027, \u0027Nervous System\u0027, \u0027Neurotransmitter Agents\u0027, \u0027Nitrogen Compounds\u0027, \u0027Onium Compounds\u0027, \u0027Parasympathomemetic (Cholinergic) Agents\u0027, \u0027Parasympathomimetics\u0027, \u0027Peripheral Nervous System Agents\u0027, \u0027Quaternary Ammonium Compounds\u0027, \u0027Trimethyl Ammonium Compounds\u0027]\tBethanechol is a synthetic ester structurally and pharmacologically related to acetylcholine.

It is sold by AstraZeneca under the trade name Imdur.\r\n\r\nIsosorbide mononitrate is used to for the the prophylactic treatment of angina pectoris; that is, it is taken in order to prevent or at least reduce the occurrence of angina. Research on Isosorbide mononitrate as a cervical ripener to reduce time at hospital to birth is supportive.\r\n\r\nIsosorbide mononitrate is an active metabolite of isosorbide dinitrate and exerts qualitatively similar effects. Isosorbide mononitrate reduces the workload of the heart by producing venous and arterial dilation. By reducing the end diastolic pressure and volume, isosorbide mononitrate lowers intramural pressure, hence leading to an improvement in the subendocardial blood flow. The net effect when administering isosorbide mononitrate is therefore a reduced workload for the heart and an improvement in the oxygen supply/demand balance of the myocardium.\r\n\r\nThe adverse reactions which follow have been reported in studies with isosorbide mononitrate:\r\nVery common. Headache predominates (up to 30%) necessitating withdrawal of 2 to 3 % of patients, but the incidence reduces rapidly as treatment continues .\r\nCommon. Tiredness, sleep disturbances (6%) and gastrointestinal disturbances (6%) have been reported during clinical trials with isosorbide mononitrate modified release tablets, but at a frequency no greater than for placebo. Hypotension (4 to 5%), poor appetite (2.5%), nausea (1%).\r\nAdverse effects associated with the clinical use of the drug are as expected with all nitrate preparations. They occur mainly in the early stages of treatment.\r\nHypotension (4%) with symptoms such as dizziness and nausea (1%) have been reported.

Despite distinct structural differences between compounds in this class, SSRIs possess similar pharmacological activity. As with other antidepressant agents, several weeks of therapy may be required before a clinical effect is seen. SSRIs are potent inhibitors of neuronal serotonin reuptake [T28]. They have little to no effect on norepinephrine or dopamine reuptake and do not antagonize \u0026alpha;- or \u0026beta;-adrenergic, dopamine D\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003e or histamine H\u003csub\u003e1\u003c/sub\u003e receptors. During acute use, SSRIs block serotonin reuptake and increase serotonin stimulation of somatodendritic 5-HT\u003csub\u003e1A\u003c/sub\u003e and terminal autoreceptors. Chronic use leads to desensitization of somatodendritic 5-HT\u003csub\u003e1A\u003c/sub\u003e and terminal autoreceptors. The overall clinical effect of increased mood and decreased anxiety is thought to be due to adaptive changes in neuronal function that leads to enhanced serotonergic neurotransmission. Side effects include dry mouth, nausea, dizziness, drowsiness, sexual dysfunction and headache (see Toxicity section below for a more detailed listing of side effects). Compared to other agents in this class, sertraline may cause greater diarrheal and male sexual dysfunction effects [A1844]. Sertraline displays a better safety or tolerability profile than other classes of antidepressants [A1846]. Side effects generally occur within the first two weeks of therapy and are usually less severe and frequent than those observed with tricyclic antidepressants or monoamine oxidase inhibitors [T28]. Sertraline has shown therapeutic effectiveness as a treatment for major depressive disorder [A1836], obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) [A1838], panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [A1841], premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) [A1842] and social anxiety disorder (social phobia).\nDB01112\tCefuroxime\tsmall molecule\t[\u0027approved\u0027]\t[\u0027S01AA27\u0027, \u0027J01DC02\u0027, \u0027J01RA03\u0027]\t[\u0027Amides\u0027, \u0027Anti-Bacterial Agents\u0027, \u0027Anti-Infective Agents\u0027, \u0027Antibacterials for Systemic Use\u0027, \u0027Antiinfectives for Systemic Use\u0027, \u0027Aza Compounds\u0027, \u0027Azabicyclo Compounds\u0027, \u0027beta-Lactams\u0027, \u0027Cefotaxime\u0027, \u0027Cephacetrile\u0027, \u0027Cephalosporins\u0027, \u0027Lactams\u0027, \u0027Nephrotoxic agents\u0027, \u0027Ophthalmologicals\u0027, \u0027Second-Generation Cephalosporins\u0027, \u0027Sensory Organs\u0027, \u0027Sulfur Compounds\u0027, \u0027Thiazines\u0027]\tBroad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic resistant to beta-lactamase.

It has been classified differently according to its drug properties in which based on its chemical structure, gliclazide is considered a first-generation sulfonylurea due to the structural presence of a sulfonamide group able to release a proton and the presence of one aromatic group.[A39546] On the other hand, based on the pharmacological efficacy, gliclazide is considered a second-generation sulfonylurea which presents a higher potency and a shorter half-life.[T238, T360] Gliclazide belongs to the sulfonylurea class of insulin secretagogues, which act by stimulating \u0026beta; cells of the pancreas to release insulin. Sulfonylureas increase both basal insulin secretion and meal-stimulated insulin release. Medications in this class differ in their dose, rate of absorption, duration of action, route of elimination and binding site on their target pancreatic \u0026beta; cell receptor. Sulfonylureas also increase peripheral glucose utilization, decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis and may increase the number and sensitivity of insulin receptors. Sulfonylureas are associated with weight gain, though less so than insulin. Due to their mechanism of action, sulfonylureas may cause hypoglycemia and require consistent food intake to decrease this risk. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased in elderly, debilitated and malnourished individuals. Gliclazide has been shown to decrease fasting plasma glucose, postprandial blood glucose and glycosolated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels (reflective of the last 8-10 weeks of glucose control). Gliclazide is extensively metabolized by the liver; its metabolites are excreted in both urine (60-70%) and feces (10-20%).\nDB01121\tPhenacemide\tsmall molecule\t[\u0027approved\u0027]\t[\u0027N03AX07\u0027]\t[\u0027Acetamides\u0027, \u0027Acetates\u0027, \u0027Acids, Acyclic\u0027, \u0027Amides\u0027, \u0027Anticonvulsants\u0027, \u0027Benzene Derivatives\u0027, \u0027Central Nervous System Depressants\u0027, \u0027Fatty Acids\u0027, \u0027Fatty Acids, Volatile\u0027, \u0027Lipids\u0027, \u0027Nervous System\u0027]\tPhenacemide is used to control certain seizures in the treatment of epilepsy.

In addition, they may inhibit certain calcium channels and therefore prevent release of neurotransmitters and inhibit glutamate channels. Volatile anesthetics easily partition into cellular membranes and could expand the volume of the cell membrane and subsequently distort channels necessary for sodium ion flux and the development of action potentials necessary for synaptic transmission.

Carbonic anhydrase (CA) is an enzyme found in many tissues of the body including the eye. It catalyzes the reversible reaction involving the hydration of carbon dioxide and the dehydration of carbonic acid. In humans, carbonic anhydrase exists as a number of isoenzymes, the most active being carbonic anhydrase II (CA-II). Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase in the ciliary processes of the eye decreases aqueous humor secretion, presumably by slowing the formation of bicarbonate ions with subsequent reduction in sodium and fluid transport. The result is a reduction in intraocular pressure.

Factor Xa catalyzes the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, so enoxaparin\u0027s inhibition of this process results in decreased thrombin and ultimately the prevention of fibrin clot formation. Low molecular weight heparins are less effective at inactivating factor IIa due to their shorter length compared to unfractionated heparin.\nDB01226\tMivacurium\tsmall molecule\t[\u0027approved\u0027]\t[\u0027M03AC10\u0027]\t[\u0027Agents producing tachycardia\u0027, \u0027Anticholinergic Agents\u0027, \u0027Central Nervous System Depressants\u0027, \u0027Cholinergic Agents\u0027, \u0027Muscarinic Antagonists\u0027, \u0027Muscle Relaxants\u0027, \u0027Muscle Relaxants, Peripherally Acting Agents\u0027, \u0027Musculo-Skeletal System\u0027, \u0027Neuromuscular Agents\u0027, \u0027Neuromuscular Blocking Agents\u0027, \u0027Neuromuscular-Blocking Agents (Nondepolarizing)\u0027, \u0027Nicotinic Antagonists\u0027, \u0027Peripheral Nervous System Agents\u0027]\tMivacurium is a bisbenzylisoquinolinium based neuromuscular blocker or muscle relaxant.

In vitro studies and in vivo pharmacologic studies have demonstrated that pirbuterol has a preferential effect on beta-2 Adrenergic receptors compared with isoproterenol. While it is recognized that beta-2 adrenergic receptors are the predominant receptors in bronchial smooth muscle, data indicate that there is a population of beta-2 receptors in the human heart, existing in a concentration between 10-50%. The precise function of these receptors has not been established.\r\n\r\nThe pharmacologic effects of beta adrenergic agonist drugs, including pirbuterol, are at least in proof attributable to stimulation through beta adrenergic receptors of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (AlP) to cyclic-3† ,5†-adenosine monophosphate (c-AMP). Increased c-AMP levels are associated with relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells.\nDB01297\tPractolol\tsmall molecule\t[\u0027approved\u0027]\t[\u0027C07AB01\u0027]\t[\u0027Acetanilides\u0027, \u0027Adrenergic Agents\u0027, \u0027Adrenergic Antagonists\u0027, \u0027Adrenergic beta-1 Receptor Antagonists\u0027, \u0027Adrenergic beta-Antagonists\u0027, \u0027Agents causing hyperkalemia\u0027, \u0027Agents that produce hypertension\u0027, \u0027Alcohols\u0027, \u0027Amides\u0027, \u0027Amines\u0027, \u0027Amino Alcohols\u0027, \u0027Anilides\u0027, \u0027Antiarrhythmic agents\u0027, \u0027Antihypertensive Agents\u0027, \u0027Beta Blocking Agents, Selective\u0027, \u0027Bradycardia-Causing Agents\u0027, \u0027Cardiovascular Agents\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Substrates\u0027, \u0027Neurotransmitter Agents\u0027, \u0027Phenoxypropanolamines\u0027, \u0027Propanolamines\u0027, \u0027Propanols\u0027]\tA beta-adrenergic antagonist that has been used in the emergency treatment of cardiac arrhythmias.\nDB01298\tSulfacytine\tsmall molecule\t[\u0027approved\u0027]\t[\u0027G01AE10\u0027]\t[\u0027Amides\u0027, \u0027Amines\u0027, \u0027Aniline Compounds\u0027, \u0027Genito Urinary System and Sex Hormones\u0027, \u0027Gynecological Antiinfectives and Antiseptics\u0027, \u0027Sulfonamides\u0027, \u0027Sulfones\u0027, \u0027Sulfur Compounds\u0027]\tSulfacytine is a short-acting sulfonamide. The sulfonamides are synthetic bacteriostatic antibiotics with a wide spectrum against most gram-positive and many gram-negative organisms. However, many strains of an individual species may be resistant. Sulfonamides inhibit multiplication of bacteria by acting as competitive inhibitors of p-aminobenzoic acid in the folic acid metabolism cycle. Bacterial sensitivity is the same for the various sulfonamides, and resistance to one sulfonamide indicates resistance to all. Most sulfonamides are readily absorbed orally. However, parenteral administration is difficult, since the soluble sulfonamide salts are highly alkaline and irritating to the tissues. The sulfonamides are widely distributed throughout all tissues. High levels are achieved in pleural, peritoneal, synovial, and ocular fluids. Although these drugs are no longer used to treat meningitis, CSF levels are high in meningeal infections.\r\n\r\nSulfacytine is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase. It inhibits bacterial synthesis of of dihydrofolic acid by preventing the condensation of the pteridine with para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), a substrate of the enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase. The inhibited reaction is necessary in these organisms for the synthesis of folic acid.\nDB01301\tRolitetracycline\tsmall molecule\t[\u0027approved\u0027]\t[\u0027J01AA20\u0027, \u0027J01AA09\u0027]\t[\u0027Agents that produce neuromuscular block (indirect)\u0027, \u0027Anti-Bacterial Agents\u0027, \u0027Anti-Infective Agents\u0027, \u0027Antibacterials for Systemic Use\u0027, \u0027Antiinfectives for Systemic Use\u0027, \u0027Naphthacenes\u0027, \u0027Tetracyclines\u0027]\tA pyrrolidinylmethyl tetracycline.

Salsalate\u0027s mode of action as an anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic agent may be due to inhibition of synthesis and release of prostaglandins. The usefulness of salicylic acid, the active in vivo product of salsalate, in the treatment of arthritic disorders has been established. In contrast to aspirin, salsalate causes no greater fecal gastrointestinal blood loss than placebo. Salsalate is readily soluble in the small intestine where it is partially hydrolyzed to two molecules of salicylic acid. A significant portion of the parent compound is absorbed unchanged and undergoes rapid esterase hydrolysis in the body. The parent compound has an elimination half-life of about 1 hour. Salicylic acid (the active metabolite) biotransformation is saturated at anti-inflammatory doses of salsalate. Such capacity limited biotransformation results in an increase in the half-life of salicylic acid from 3.5 to 16 or more hours.\nDB01401\tCholine magnesium trisalicylate\tsmall molecule\t[\u0027approved\u0027]\t[]\t[\u0027Acids, Carbocyclic\u0027, \u0027Agents causing hyperkalemia\u0027, \u0027Agents that produce hypertension\u0027, \u0027Alcohols\u0027, \u0027Amines\u0027, \u0027Amino Alcohols\u0027, \u0027Ammonium Compounds\u0027, \u0027Analgesics\u0027, \u0027Analgesics, Non-Narcotic\u0027, \u0027Anti-Inflammatory Agents\u0027, \u0027Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal\u0027, \u0027Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal (Non-Selective)\u0027, \u0027Benzene Derivatives\u0027, \u0027Benzoates\u0027, \u0027Central Nervous System Agents\u0027, \u0027Ethanolamines\u0027, \u0027Hydroxy Acids\u0027, \u0027Hydroxybenzoates\u0027, \u0027Nephrotoxic agents\u0027, \u0027Nitrogen Compounds\u0027, \u0027Onium Compounds\u0027, \u0027Peripheral Nervous System Agents\u0027, \u0027Phenols\u0027, \u0027Quaternary Ammonium Compounds\u0027, \u0027Sensory System Agents\u0027, \u0027Trimethyl Ammonium Compounds\u0027]\tCholine magnesium trisalicylate is a non-acetylated salicylate used widely as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug.

The antihistamines antagonize those pharmacological effects of histamine which are mediated through activation of H1- receptor sites and thereby reduce the intensity of allergic reactions and tissue injury response involving histamine release.  It is used to treat sneezing, runny nose, itching, watery eyes, hives, rashes, itching, and other symptoms of allergies and the common cold.\r\nSymptoms of a phenindamine overdose include extreme sleepiness, confusion, weakness, ringing in the ears, blurred vision, large pupils, dry mouth, flushing, fever, shaking, insomnia, hallucinations, and possibly seizures.\r\nDB01620\tPheniramine\tsmall molecule\t[\u0027approved\u0027]\t[\u0027R06AB05\u0027, \u0027D04AA16\u0027]\t[\u0027Anti-Allergic Agents\u0027, \u0027Antihistamines for Systemic Use\u0027, \u0027Antihistamines for Topical Use\u0027, \u0027Antipruritics\u0027, \u0027Antipruritics, Incl.

Nylidrin is a peripheral vasodilator. Some studies show the evidence of improving cognitive impairment in selected individuals, such as geriatric patients with mild to moderate symptoms of cognitive, emotional and physical impairment [L2279].\r\n\r\nNylidrin is utilized to treat several disorders that may benefit from increased blood flow (for example, certain mental disorders, blood vessel disease due to diabetes, frostbite, night leg cramps, and certain types of ulcers). This medication works by dilating (widening) blood vessels to help increase blood flow (improving circulation) throughout the body, including the extremities and central nervous system. This effect may help to improve memory/judgment, improve walking ability, and support the healing of frostbite/ulcers [L2283].\r\n\r\nFDA has considered nylidrin as \"lacking substantial evidence of effectiveness\" in cerebral ischemia, cerebral arteriosclerosis, and other cerebral circulatory insufficiencies.

It is a vasodilator with properties that are quite similar to those of glyceryl trinitrate, however, with a more prolonged duration of action. It is also one of the most powerful high explosives known and is a component of the plastic explosive known as Semtex [L2393].\r\n\r\nPETN has the chemical formula C5H8N4O12. It is formed by reacting pentaerythritol (C5H12O4), an alcohol commonly used in paints and varnishes, with nitric acid (HNO2). The reacting solution is chilled to precipitate the PETN.  It is then filtered out, washed, dried, and recrystallized to produce a colorless crystalline material that is stored and shipped as a mixture with water and alcohol [L2394].\r\n\r\nInterestingly, this drug was studied for potential benefits in chronic ischemic heart failure patients.

Similar to clopidogrel, prasugrel is a prodrug that requires enzymatic transformation in the liver to its active metabolite, R-138727. R-138727 irreversibly binds to P2Y12 type ADP receptors on platelets thus preventing activation of the GPIIb/IIIa receptor complex. As a result, inhibition of ADP-mediated platelet activation and aggregation occurs. Prasugrel was developed by Daiichi Sankyo Co. and is currently marketed in the United States and Canada in cooperation with Eli Lilly and Company for acute coronary syndromes planned for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Like all NS3/4A inhibitors, simeprevir is a serine protease inhibitor in similarity to [DB08873] and [DB05521] but is classified as a second generation protease inhibitor. This class of antiviral drugs were the first direct acting antivirals approved but are associated with lower cure rates than newer drugs. Broad use of simeprevir occurred when it was used in combination with a newer drug, [DB08934]. Inhibiting HCV NS3/4A protease in a potent and highly specific manner, simeprevir is a direct-acting antiviral agent against the hepatitis C virus. Since the viral protease NS3/4A complex is essential for cleaving the HCV encoded polyprotein into individual viral proteins facilitating replication [A19632], the drug blocks the viral replication process. It is shown to display synergistic effects with interferon-α and HCV NS5B inhibitor, and additive effects with ribavirin in HCV replicon cells [A19629]. Unlike first generation serine protease inhibitors, simprevir has a sightly different resistance profile where limited therapeutic efficacy of the drug is observed with NS3 Q80K polymorphic variants and simeprevir-specific amino acid position of 168 also results in higher treatment failure rates [A19630]. The observed prevalence of the N3 Q80K polymorphism was 30% in subjects infected with HCV genotype 1a and 0.5% in subjects infected with HCV genotype 1b [A19630]. \r\n\r\nAccording to 2017 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and 2015 consensus guidelines from the Canadian Association for the Study of the Liver (CASL), simeprevir can be used as first-line or second-line threapies for treatment-naïve patients as adjunct to sofosbuvir treatment for genotype 1 or PEG-Interferon/ribavirin combination therapy for genotype 1 or 4. The combination therapy of simeprevir and other antiviral agents are initiated in HCV-positive patients with the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 12 weeks of daily therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626].\r\n\r\nSimeprevir was approved by the FDA in November 2014 and is marketed under the brand name Olysio as oral tablets. Administered once daily with food, 150mg simeprevir capsule is used in combination with [DB08934] in patients with HCV genotype 1 without cirrhosis for 12 week duration. In patients with HCV genotype 1 with compensated cirrhosis, the treatment is directed for 24 week duration. Sustained virologic response 12 weeks after planned end of treatment (SVR12) was achieved in 170/176 (97%) subjects without cirrhosis treated with 12 weeks simeprevir in combination with sofosbuvir (FDA Label). The overall SVR12 was 88% (44/50) in treatment-naïve patients with cirrhosis [L852].\r\n\r\nSimeprevir is also used in treatment of HCV genotype 4 patients with or without cirrhosis and is taken with [DB00008] and [DB00811]; this triple therapy allows shortening treatment duration from 48 weeks or longer to 12 or 24 weeks [A19630] depending on prior response status and presence of HIV-1 co-infection. Prior to initiation of treatment with [DB00008] and [DB00811], screening for the presence of virus with the NS3 Q80K polymorphism is strongly recommended and if detected, alternative treatment should be considered instead to prevent therapeutic failure. The SVR12 was 83% (29/35) in treatment-naïve patients and 86% (19/22) in relapsing patients.\nDB06292\tDapagliflozin\tsmall molecule\t[\u0027approved\u0027]\t[\u0027A10BX09\u0027, \u0027A10BD15\u0027, \u0027A10BD21\u0027]\t[\u0027Alimentary Tract and Metabolism\u0027, \u0027Benzene Derivatives\u0027, \u0027Blood Glucose Lowering Agents\u0027, \u0027Carbohydrates\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 CYP2A6 Substrates\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Substrates\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Substrates\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027Diuretics\u0027, \u0027Drugs Used in Diabetes\u0027, \u0027Glycosides\u0027, \u0027Hypotensive Agents\u0027, \u0027Oral Hypoglycemics\u0027, \u0027P-glycoprotein/ABCB1 Substrates\u0027, \u0027Sodium-glucose Cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027Sodium-Glucose Transport Proteins, antagonists \u0026 inhibitors\u0027, \u0027Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027UGT1A9 Substrates\u0027]\tDapagliflozin is indicated for the management of diabetes mellitus type 2, and functions to improve glycemic control in adults when combined with diet and exercise.

The primary function of endogenous C1INH is to regulate the activation of the complement and contact system pathways. It does this through inhibition of several target proteases within these pathways including activated C1s, kallikrein, factor XIIa and factor XIa. C1 esterase inhibitor has also been shown to inhibit the action of thrombin within the coagulation pathway, and tPA and plasmin within the fibrinolytic pathway. Deficiency of C1-inhibitor permits plasma kallikrein activation, which leads to the production of the vasoactive peptide bradykinin. Additionally, C4 and C2 cleavage goes unchecked, resulting in auto-activation of the complement system. Down-stream effects of the lack of enzyme inhibition by C1 esterase inhibitor results in swelling due to leakage of fluid from blood vessels into connective tissue and consequently the presentation of hereditary angioedema (HAE). \r\n\r\nMarketed as the product Cyrinze (FDA), this drug is indicated for routine prophylaxis against angioedema attacks in adolescent and adult patients with Hereditary Angioedema (HAE), a human genetic disorder caused by a shortage of C1 inhibitor activity that results in an overreaction of the immune system.

Considered a natural source of surfactant as it is made from bovine lung extract, beractant contains a mixture of phospholipids, neutral lipids, fatty acids, and surfactant-associated proteins such as SP-B and SP-C. The final composition provides 25 mg/mL phospholipids (including 11.0-15.5 mg/mL disaturated phosphatidylcholine), 0.5-1.75 mg/mL triglycerides, 1.4-3.5 mg/mL free fatty acids, and less than 1.0 mg/mL protein. It is suspended in 0.9% sodium chloride solution, and heat-sterilized. \r\n\r\nIn anticipation of birth, endogenous lung surfactant is produced to lower the surface tension on alveolar surfaces and to stabilize the alveoli against collapse at resting transpulmonary pressures. However, in Respiratory Distress Syndrome, developmental deficiency of surfactant results collapse of the alveoli causing fast breathing, increased heart rate, apoxia, and sometimes death.  Administration of lung surfactant remains the cornerstone of therapy in this condition that is currently the leading cause of death in preterm infants. In comparison to synthetic forms of surfacant, natural forms such as Beractant have been found to have a reduced incidence of pneumothorax and reduced mortality.\nDB06762\tPinacidil\tsmall molecule\t[\u0027approved\u0027]\t[\u0027C02DG01\u0027, \u0027C02LX01\u0027]\t[\u0027Amidines\u0027, \u0027Antihypertensive Agents\u0027, \u0027Arteriolar Smooth Muscle, Agents Acting On\u0027, \u0027Cardiovascular Agents\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates\u0027, \u0027Guanidine Derivatives\u0027, \u0027Guanidines\u0027, \u0027Membrane Transport Modulators\u0027, \u0027Vasodilating Agents\u0027]\tPinacidil is a cyanoguanidine drug that opens ATP-sensitive potassium channels producing peripheral vasodilatation of arterioles.

From there, inhibition is caused due to the lower intraluminal calcium levels, which is typically available for absorption.

This forms as large, bright blue crystals containing five molecules of water (CuSO4∙5H2O) and is also known as _blue vitriol_. The anhydrous salt is created by heating the hydrate to 150 °C (300 °F). Cupric sulfate is used primarily for agricultural purposes, as a pesticide, germicide, feed additive, and soil additive. Some of its secondary uses are as a raw material in the preparation of other copper compounds, as a reagent in analytic chemistry, as an electrolyte for batteries and electroplating baths, and in medical practice as a locally applied fungicide, bactericide, and astringent [L1820].\r\n\r\nCopper is an essential trace element and an important catalyst for heme synthesis and iron absorption. After zinc and iron, copper is the third most abundant trace element found in the human body. Copper is a noble metal and its properties include high thermal and electrical conductivity, low corrosion, alloying ability, and malleability.  Copper is a component of intrauterine contraceptive devices  (IUD) and the release of copper is necessary for their important contraceptive effects. The average daily intake of copper in the USA is approximately  1 mg Cu with the diet being a primary source [A32221].\r\n\r\nInterestingly, the dysregulation of copper has been studied with a focus on neurodegenerative diseases, such as Wilson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease. Data from clinical observations of the neurotoxic effects of copper may provide the basis for future treatments affecting copper and its homeostasis [L1830].\nDB06779\tDalteparin\tsmall molecule\t[\u0027approved\u0027]\t[\u0027B01AB04\u0027]\t[\u0027Agents causing hyperkalemia\u0027, \u0027Anticoagulants\u0027, \u0027Blood and Blood Forming Organs\u0027, \u0027Carbohydrates\u0027, \u0027Cardiovascular Agents\u0027, \u0027Fibrin Modulating Agents\u0027, \u0027Fibrinolytic Agents\u0027, \u0027Glycosaminoglycans\u0027, \u0027Hematologic Agents\u0027, \u0027Heparin (Low Molecular Weight)\u0027, \u0027Heparin and similars\u0027, \u0027Polysaccharides\u0027]\tDalteparin, a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) prepared by nitrous acid degradation of unfractionated heparin of porcine intestinal mucosa origin, is an anticoagulant.

In the crystalline state, it exists as a centrosymmetric dimer. Due to its dynamic fungistatic and bacteriostatic properties, pyrithione zinc is used to treat dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis. Dandruff is a common scalp disease affecting \u003e40% of the world\u0027s adult population, and may be caused by fungi such as _Malassezia globosa_ and _M. restricta_ [A32162].\r\n\r\nPyrithione zinc is commonly found as an active ingredient in OTC antidandruff topical treatments such as shampoos. It mediates its action by increasing the cellular levels of copper, and damaging iron-sulfur clusters of proteins essential for fungal metabolism and growth [A27132]. Due to low solubility, pyrithione zinc released from the topical formulations is deposited and retained relatively well onto the target skin surfaces [A27133]. Other uses of pyrithione zinc include additive in antifouling outdoor paints and algaecide. While its use has been approved in the early 1960\u0027s by the FDA [A32163], safety and effectiveness of pyrithione zinc has been reported for decades.

Cystic Fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by one of several different mutations in the gene for the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) protein, an ion channel involved in the transport of chloride and sodium ions across cell membranes. CFTR is active in epithelial cells of organs such as of the lungs, pancreas, liver, digestive system, and reproductive tract. Alterations in the CFTR gene result in altered production, misfolding, or function of the protein and consequently abnormal fluid and ion transport across cell membranes [A20298, A20299]. As a result, CF patients produce a thick, sticky mucus that clogs the ducts of organs where it is produced making patients more susceptible to complications such as infections, lung damage, pancreatic insufficiency, and malnutrition [A20302]. \r\n\r\nUse of Ivacaftor has been shown to both improve CF symptoms and modulate underlying disease pathology. This is achieved by potentiating the channel opening probability (or gating) of CFTR protein in patients with impaired gating mechanisms. This is in contrast to [DB09280], another CF medication, that functions by preventing misfolding of the CFTR protein and thereby results in increased processing and trafficking of mature protein to the cell surface. Results from clinical trials indicated that treatment with ivacaftor results in improved lung function, reduced chance of experiencing a pulmonary exacerbation, increased weight gain, and improvements in CF symptoms [FDA Label]. This data has been heavily scrutinized, however, with clinical trials showing only modest improvements despite a hefty yearly cost of $259,000 for Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) [A20343].\r\n\r\nA wide variety of CFTR mutations correlate to the Cystic Fibrosis phenotype and are associated with differing levels of disease severity. The most common mutation, affecting approximately 70% of patients with CF worldwide, is known as F508del-CFTR or delta-F508 (ΔF508), in which a deletion in the amino acid phenylalanine at position 508 results in impaired production of the CFTR protein, thereby causing a significant reduction in the amount of ion transporter present on cell membranes [A20301]. Ivacaftor as monotherapy has failed to show a benefit for patients with delta-F508 mutations, most likely due to insufficient amount of protein available at the cell membrane for interaction and potentiation by the drug[A20305]. The next most common mutation, G551D, affecting 4-5% of CF patients worldwide is characterized as a missense mutation, whereby there is sufficient amount of protein at the cell surface, but opening and closing mechanisms of the channel are altered [A17564]. Ivacaftor is indicated for the management of CF in patients with this second type of mutation, as it binds to and potentiates the channel opening ability of CFTR proteins on the cell membrane [A17564].\r\n\r\nAlthough ivacaftor has not shown any significant improvements in patients with the delta-F508 mutation, it has shown significant improvements (\u003e10% increase in FEV1 from baseline) in lung function for the following mutations: E56K, P67L, R74W, D110E, D110H, R117C, R117H, G178R, E193K, L206W, R347H, R352Q, A455E, S549N, S549R, G551D, G551S, D579G, S945L, S977F, F1052V, K1060T, A1067T, G1069R, R1070Q, R1070W, F1074L, D1152H, G1244E, S1251N, S1255P, D1270N, and G1349D [FDA Label]. This list was expanded by the FDA in May 2017 from 10 to 33 to accomodate more rare mutations [L768]. \r\n\r\nWhen used as monotherapy as the product Kalydeco, ivacaftor is indicated for the managmenet of CF in patients age 2 years and older who have a mutation in the CFTR gene that is responsive to ivacaftor potentiation (see above list of susceptible mutations). \r\n\r\nWhen used in combination with the drug [DB09280] as the product Orkambi, ivacaftor is indicated for the management of CF patients age 6 years and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene.\r\n\r\nPrior to the development of ivacaftor, management of CF primarily involved therapies for the control of infections, nutritional support, clearance of mucus, and management of symptoms rather than improvements in the underlying disease process or lung function (FEV1). Notably, ivacaftor was the first medication approved for the management of the underlying causes of CF (abnormalities in CFTR protein function) rather than control of symptoms [A20297].\r\n\r\nIvacaftor is manufactured and distributed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals.

It is a derivative of 19-norprogesterone and has both antagonistic and partial agonist activity at the progesterone receptor. It also binds to glucocorticoid receptor, however compared to mifepristone (a progesterone receptor antagonist), ulipristal is more tolerable and has lower glucocorticoid activity and better binding affinity. \r\n\r\nUlipristal is currently recommended as first line therapy for emergency contraception, due to improved efficacy and similar side effect profile as compared to the traditional use of levonorgestrel or the Yuzpe regimen. The exact mechanism of action for ulipristal is still currently debated, though there is evidence that it functions by inhibiting ovulation. A recent systematic review proclaimed that the majority of available evidence demonstrates an inhibitory effect on ovulation rather than a post-fertilization effect on the endometrium, which has been heavily debated due to ethical concerns related to abortion (Rosato et al, 2016).\nDB08874\tFidaxomicin\tsmall molecule\t[\u0027approved\u0027]\t[\u0027A07AA12\u0027]\t[\u0027Alimentary Tract and Metabolism\u0027, \u0027Anti-Bacterial Agents\u0027, \u0027Antidiarrheals, Intestinal Antiinflammatory/antiinfective Agents\u0027, \u0027Carbohydrates\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027Glycosides\u0027, \u0027Intestinal Antiinfectives\u0027, \u0027Macrolide Antibacterial\u0027, \u0027Macrolides\u0027, \u0027Other Macrolides\u0027, \u0027P-glycoprotein/ABCB1 Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027P-glycoprotein/ABCB1 Substrates\u0027]\tOne of the first narrow spectrum macrocyclic antibiotic, it is a natural compound and is structurally similar to compounds in lipiarmycin-a fermentation mixture.

HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as sofosbuvir. As a prodrug nucleotide analog, Sofosbuvir is metabolized into its active form as the antiviral agent 2\u0027-deoxy-2\u0027-α-fluoro-β-C-methyluridine-5\u0027-triphosphate (also known as GS-461203), which acts as a defective substrate for NS5B (non-structural protein 5B) [synthesis]. NS5B, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, is essential for the transcription of Hepatitis C viral RNA and for its high replicative rate and genetic diversity [A19594]. Sofosbuvir and other direct acting antivirals are therefore very potent options for the treatment of Hepatitis C, as they exhibit a high barrier to the development of resistance [A19593]. This is an important advantage relative to HCV drugs that target other viral enzymes such as the protease, for which rapid development of resistance has proven to be an important cause of therapeutic failure.  \r\n\r\nIn a joint recommendation published in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend Sofosbuvir as first line therapy in combination with other antivirals for all six genotypes of Hepatitis C [L852]. Depending on the genotype, sofosbuvir is often used in combination with other antivirals such as [DB09027], [DB11613], [DB09102], [DB06290], [DB11574], [DB11575], [DB00811], [DB00008], or [DB00022] with the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 12 weeks of daily therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626]. Treatment with direct acting antivirals such as sofosbuvir is associated with very minimal side effects, with the most common being headache and fatigue [FDA Label]. Lack of significant side effects and short duration of therapy is a considerable advantage over older interferon- and ribavirin-based regimens, which were limited by infusion site reactions, reduced blood count, and neuropsychiatric effects [A19635]. \r\n\r\nSince 2014, sofosbuvir has been available as a fixed dose combination product with [DB09027] (tradename Harvoni) used for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis C. Approved in October 2014 by the FDA, Harvoni is indicated for the treatment of HCV genotypes 1, 4, 5, and 6 with or without [DB00811] depending on the level of liver damage or cirrhosis [FDA Label].  When combined together, ledipasvir and sofosbuvir as the combination product Harvoni has been shown to achieve a SVR between 93 and 99% after 12 weeks of treatment [A7535]. Its use has also proven successful in the treatment of HCV in patients co-infected with HIV [A19627].\r\n\r\nSofosbuvir is also available as a fixed dose combination product with [DB11613] as the commercially available product Epclusa. First approved in June 2016, Epclusa is the first combination HCV product indicated for the treatment of all genotypes of Hepatitis C with or without cirrhosis. Epclusa is also currently the most potent HCV antiviral medication on the market with a sustained virologic response (SVR) after 12 weeks of therapy of 93-99% depending on genotype and level of cirrhosis [L852]. Both Canadian and American guidelines list Epclusa as a first line recommendation for all genotypes of HCV [L852, A19626].\r\n\r\nNotably, sofosbuvir has come under intense scrutiny since its release to market in 2013. With the price per pill set at $1000, a 12-week treatment can cost upwards of $84,000 per patient [A19636].\nDB08936\tChlorcyclizine\tsmall molecule\t[\u0027approved\u0027]\t[\u0027R06AE04\u0027]\t[\u0027Antihistamines for Systemic Use\u0027, \u0027Histamine Antagonists\u0027, \u0027Histamine H1 Antagonists\u0027, \u0027Piperazine Derivatives\u0027, \u0027Potential QTc-Prolonging Agents\u0027, \u0027QTc Prolonging Agents\u0027]\tChlorcyclizine is a first generation phenylpiperazine class antihistamine used to treat urticaria, rhinitis, pruritus, and other allergy symptoms.

HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as ledipasvir. More specifically, ledipasvir is an inhibitor of the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Non-Structural Protein 5A (NS5A), which is required for viral RNA replication and assembly of HCV virions. Although its exact mechanism of action is unknown, it is postulated to prevent hyperphosphorylation of NS5A which is required for viral protein production. It is effective against genotypes 1a, 1b, 4a, and 5a and with a lesser activity against genotypes 2a and 3a of HCV. Ledipasvir and other direct acting antivirals are very potent options for the treatment of Hepatitis C, as they exhibit a high barrier to the development of resistance [A19593]. This is an important advantage relative to HCV drugs that target other viral enzymes such as the protease, for which rapid development of resistance has proven to be an important cause of therapeutic failure.  \r\n\r\nIn a joint recommendation published in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend ledipasvir as a first line therapy option in combination with [DB08934] for the treatment of HCV genotypes 1a, 1b, 4, 5, and 6 [L852]. Treatment with ledipasvir is used with the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 12 weeks of daily therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626]. Treatment with direct acting antivirals such as ledipasvir is associated with very minimal side effects, with the most common being headache and fatigue [FDA Label]. Lack of significant side effects and short duration of therapy is a considerable advantage over older interferon- and ribavirin-based regimens, which were limited by infusion site reactions, reduced blood count, and neuropsychiatric effects [A19635]. \r\n\r\nSince 2014, ledipasvir has been available as a fixed dose combination product with [DB08934] (tradename Harvoni) used for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis C. Approved in October 2014 by the FDA, Harvoni is indicated for the treatment of HCV genotypes 1, 4, 5, and 6 with or without [DB00811] depending on the level of liver damage or cirrhosis [FDA Label].  When combined together, ledipasvir and sofosbuvir as the combination product Harvoni has been shown to achieve a SVR between 93 and 99% after 12 weeks of treatment [FDA Label]. Its use has also proven successful in the treatment of HCV in patients co-infected with HIV [A19627].\nDB09029\tSecukinumab\tbiotech\t[\u0027approved\u0027]\t[\u0027L04AC10\u0027]\t[\u0027Agents reducing cytokine levels\u0027, \u0027Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins\u0027, \u0027Antibodies\u0027, \u0027Antineoplastic and Immunomodulating Agents\u0027, \u0027Blood Proteins\u0027, \u0027Globulins\u0027, \u0027Immunoglobulins\u0027, \u0027Immunoproteins\u0027, \u0027Immunosuppressive Agents\u0027, \u0027Interleukin Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027Interleukin-17, antagonists \u0026 inhibitors\u0027, \u0027Interleukin-17A Antagonist\u0027, \u0027Interleukin-17A Antagonists\u0027, \u0027Misc.

Affecting less than 500 people worldwide, lipodystrophy is characterized by a lack of adipose tissue, fat deposition in the muscles and liver, and metabolic complications such as hypertriglyceridemia, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, and fatty liver disease. These metabolic abnormalities are often aggravated by excessive food intake, which is further aggravated by leptin deficiency, a protein secreted by adipose tissue. Administration of Metreleptin results in improvement of metabolic symptoms including improvements in insulin resistance, reduced HbA1c and fasting glucose, reduced triglycerides, and reductions in food intake. Metreleptin is produced in E. coli and differs from native human leptin by the addition of a methionine residue at its amino terminus. It is administered as a once daily subcutaneous injection. On Feb. 24, 2014, Metreleptin was approved by the FDA for the treatment of complications of leptin deficiency, in addition to diet, in patients with congenital generalized or acquired generalized lipodystrophy.

For the treatment of relapsed CLL, it is currently indicated as a second-line agent in combination with rituximab in patients for whom rituximab alone would be considered appropriate therapy due to other co-morbidities, while in the treatment of FL and SLL it is intended to be used in patients who have received at least two prior systemic therapies. More specifically, idelalisib targets P110δ, the delta isoform of the enzyme phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, also known as PI-3K. The PI-3Ks are a family of enzymes involved in cellular functions such as cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, motility, survival and intracellular trafficking, which in turn are involved in cancer. In contrast to the other class IA PI3Ks p110α and p110β, p110δ is principally expressed in leukocytes (white blood cells) and is important for the function of T cells, B cell, mast cells and neutrophils. By inhibiting this enzyme, idelalisib induces apoptosis of malignant cells and inhibits several cell signaling pathways, including B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling and C-X-C chemokine receptors type 5 and type 4 signalling, which are involved in trafficking and homing of B-cells to the lymph nodes and bone marrow. Treatment of lymphoma cells with idelalisib has been shown to result in inhibition of chemotaxis and adhesion, and reduced cell viability.\nDB09057\tAnthrax immune globulin human\tbiotech\t[\u0027approved\u0027]\t[]\t[\u0027Immunoglobulins\u0027, \u0027Serum Globulins\u0027, \u0027Vaccines\u0027]\tAnthrax immune globulin is a human immune globulin that is used in combination with antibiotics to treat anthrax.

About 4% of patients with NSCLC have a chromosomal rearrangement that generates a fusion gene between EML4 (echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4) and ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase), which results in constitutive kinase activity that contributes to carcinogenesis and seems to drive the malignant phenotype. Ceritinib exerts its therapeutic effect by inhibiting autophosphorylation of ALK, ALK-mediated phosphorylation of the downstream signaling protein STAT3, and proliferation of ALK-dependent cancer cells. Following treatment with crizotinib (a first-generation ALK inhibitor), most tumours develop drug resistance due to mutations in key \"gatekeeper\" residues of the enzyme. This occurrence led to development of novel second-generation ALK inhibitors such as ceritinib to overcome crizotinib resistance. The FDA approved ceritinib in April 2014 due to a surprisingly high response rate (56%) towards crizotinib-resistant tumours and has designated it with orphan drug status.\nDB09065\tCobicistat\tsmall molecule\t[\u0027approved\u0027]\t[\u0027J05AR14\u0027, \u0027J05AR18\u0027, \u0027V03AX03\u0027, \u0027J05AR15\u0027, \u0027J05AR09\u0027]\t[\u0027Acids, Acyclic\u0027, \u0027Anti-HIV Agents\u0027, \u0027Anti-Infective Agents\u0027, \u0027Antiinfectives for Systemic Use\u0027, \u0027BCRP/ABCG2 Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027Breast Cancer Resistance Protein Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027Carbamates\u0027, \u0027Chemically-Induced Disorders\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors (weak)\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors (strong)\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors (strong)\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Inhibitors (strong)\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Substrates\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A7 Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A7 Inhibitors (strong)\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A7 Substrates\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P450 2D6 Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P450 3A Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027Enzyme Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027OATP1B1/SLCO1B1 Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027OATP1B3 inhibitors\u0027, \u0027Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide 1B1 Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide 1B3 Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027Other Miscellaneous Therapeutic Agents\u0027, \u0027P-glycoprotein/ABCB1 Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027Sulfur Compounds\u0027, \u0027Thiazoles\u0027]\tCobicistat, trade name Tybost (formerly GS-9350), is a licensed drug for use in the treatment of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

PARP enzymes are involved in normal cellular homeostasis, such as DNA transcription, cell cycle regulation, and DNA repair. Olaparib has been shown to inhibit growth of select tumor cell lines in vitro and decrease tumor growth in mouse xenograft models of human cancer both as monotherapy or following platinum-based chemotherapy. Increased cytotoxicity and anti-tumor activity following treatment with olaparib were noted in cell lines and mouse tumor models with deficiencies in BRCA. In vitro studies have shown that olaparib-induced cytotoxicity may involve inhibition of PARP enzymatic activity and increased formation of PARP-DNA complex, resulting in disruption of cellular homeostasis and cell death.\r\n\r\nOlaparib is available as oral tablets marketed under the brand name Lynparza and was initially indicated as a maintenance therapy or monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer.

By inhibiting factor Xa, a key protein in the coagulation cascade, edoxaban prevents the stepwise amplification of protein factors needed to form blood clots. It is indicated to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism (SE) in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) following 5-10 days of initial therapy with a parenteral anticoagulant. Traditionally, warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, was used for stroke prevention in these individuals but effective use of this drug is limited by it\u0027s delayed onset, narrow therapeutic window, need for regular monitoring and INR testing, and numerous drug-drug and drug-food interactions. This has prompted enthusiasm for newer agents such as dabigatran, apixaban, and rivaroxaban for effective clot prevention. In addition to once daily dosing, the benefits over warfarin also include significant reductions in hemorrhagic stroke and GI bleeding, and improved compliance, which is beneficial as many patients will be on lifelong therapy. \nDB09076\tUmeclidinium\tsmall molecule\t[\u0027approved\u0027]\t[\u0027R03BB07\u0027, \u0027R03AL03\u0027]\t[\u0027Adrenergics, Inhalants\u0027, \u0027Agents producing tachycardia\u0027, \u0027Agents to Treat Airway Disease\u0027, \u0027Anticholinergic Agents\u0027, \u0027Antimuscarinics Antispasmodics\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Substrates\u0027, \u0027Drugs for Obstructive Airway Diseases\u0027, \u0027Muscarinic Antagonists\u0027, \u0027P-glycoprotein/ABCB1 Substrates\u0027, \u0027Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive, drug therapy\u0027]\tUmeclidinium is a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) used as maintenance treatment for symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is available as a once-daily inhalation monotherapy or as a fixed-dose combination product with the long-acting beta2-agonist vilanterol. COPD is a progressive obstructive lung disease characterized by shortness of breath, cough, sputum production, and chronically poor airflow with a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of less than 80%. By blocking the M3 muscarinic receptor which is highly expressed in airway smooth muscle of the lungs, umeclidinium inhibits the binding of acetylcholine and thereby opens up the airways by preventing bronchoconstriction. Its use has been shown to provide clinically significant, sustained improvements in lung function.\nDB09079\tNintedanib\tsmall molecule\t[\u0027approved\u0027]\t[\u0027L01XE31\u0027]\t[\u0027Antifibrotic Agents\u0027, \u0027Antineoplastic Agents\u0027, \u0027Antineoplastic and Immunomodulating Agents\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates\u0027, \u0027Enzyme Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027Kinase Inhibitor\u0027, \u0027P-glycoprotein/ABCB1 Substrates\u0027, \u0027Protein Kinase Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors\u0027]\tNintedanib is a drug indicated for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) that targets multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and non-receptor tyrosine kinases (nRTKs). Nintedanib inhibits the following RTKs: platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) α and β, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 1-3, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) 1-3, and Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3). Among them, FGFR, PDGFR, and VEGFR have been implicated in IPF pathogenesis. Nintedanib binds competitively to the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding pocket of these receptors and blocks the intracellular signaling which is crucial for the proliferation, migration, and transformation of fibroblasts representing essential mechanisms of the IPF pathology. In addition, nintedanib inhibits the following nRTKs: Lck, Lyn and Src kinases. The contribution of FLT3 and nRTK inhibition to IPF efficacy is unknown.\r\n\r\nIdiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and ultimately fatal lung disease characterized by a progressive loss of lung function with worsening dyspnoea and cough. Development is thought to be instigated by repetitive lung injury (such as by cigarette smoke, industrial dusts, gastrooesophageal reflux and viral infection) leading to destruction of epithelial alveolar cells. Subsequent dysregulation of the repair process results in the proliferation/migration of fibroblasts and their differentiation into myofibroblasts, abnormal extracellular matrix deposition and excessive collagen accumulation in the lung interstitium and alveolar space, leading to progressive fibrosis and stiffening of the lungs. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) mediate various processes, including fibrogenesis and angiogenesis, and are implicated in the pathogenesis of IPF. By blocking substrate binding and downstream signalling cascades, nintedanib interferes with processes active in fibrosis such as fibroblast proliferation, migration and differentiation, and the secretion of extracellular matrix.\nDB09080\tOlodaterol\tsmall molecule\t[\u0027approved\u0027]\t[\u0027R03AL06\u0027, \u0027R03AC19\u0027]\t[\u0027Adrenergic Agents\u0027, \u0027Adrenergic Agonists\u0027, \u0027Adrenergic beta-1 Receptor Agonists\u0027, \u0027Adrenergic beta-2 Receptor Agonists\u0027, \u0027Adrenergic beta-Agonists\u0027, \u0027Adrenergics, Inhalants\u0027, \u0027Agents producing tachycardia\u0027, \u0027Agents that produce hypertension\u0027, \u0027Agents to Treat Airway Disease\u0027, \u0027Anti-Asthmatic Agents\u0027, \u0027Autonomic Agents\u0027, \u0027Bronchodilator Agents\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Substrates\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Substrates\u0027, \u0027Drugs for Obstructive Airway Diseases\u0027, \u0027Neurotransmitter Agents\u0027, \u0027Oxazines\u0027, \u0027Peripheral Nervous System Agents\u0027, \u0027Potential QTc-Prolonging Agents\u0027, \u0027QTc Prolonging Agents\u0027, \u0027Respiratory System Agents\u0027, \u0027Selective Beta 2-adrenergic Agonists\u0027]\tOlodaterol is a novel, long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist (LABA) that exerts its pharmacological effect by binding and activating beta2-adrenergic receptors located primarily in the lungs. Beta2-adrenergic receptors are membrane-bound receptors that are normally activated by endogenous epinephrine whose signalling, via a downstream L-type calcium channel interaction, mediates smooth muscle relaxation and bronchodilation. Activation of the receptor stimulates an associated G protein which then activates adenylate cyclase, catalyzing the formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and protein kinase A (PKA). Elevation of these two molecules induces bronchodilation by relaxation of airway smooth muscles. It is by this mechanism that olodaterol is used for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and the progressive airflow obstruction that is characteristic of it. Treatment with bronchodilators helps to mitigate associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, cough, and sputum production. Single doses of olodaterol have been shown to improve forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1) for 24 h in patients with COPD, allowing once daily dosing. A once-a-day treatment with a LABA has several advantages over short-acting bronchodilators and twice-daily LABAs including improved convenience and compliance and improved airflow over a 24-hour period. Despite similarities in symptoms, olodaterol is not indicated for the treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD or for the treatment of asthma.\nDB09082\tVilanterol\tsmall molecule\t[\u0027approved\u0027]\t[\u0027R03AK10\u0027, \u0027R03AL03\u0027]\t[\u0027Adrenergic Agonists\u0027, \u0027Adrenergic beta-2 Receptor Agonists\u0027, \u0027Adrenergic beta-Agonists\u0027, \u0027Adrenergics, Inhalants\u0027, \u0027Agents producing tachycardia\u0027, \u0027Agents that produce hypertension\u0027, \u0027Agents to Treat Airway Disease\u0027, \u0027Alcohols\u0027, \u0027Benzene Derivatives\u0027, \u0027Benzyl Compounds\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates\u0027, \u0027Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates\u0027, \u0027Drugs for Obstructive Airway Diseases\u0027, \u0027Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated\u0027, \u0027Hydrocarbons, Halogenated\u0027, \u0027Immunosuppressive Agents\u0027, \u0027Potential QTc-Prolonging Agents\u0027, \u0027QTc Prolonging Agents\u0027]\tVilanterol is a selective long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist (LABA) with inherent 24-hour activity for once daily treatment of COPD and asthma.

Ivabradine, brand name Corlanor, was approved by the FDA in April 2015 for the treatment of chronic heart failure in patients with an ejection fraction of ≤35%, in sinus rhythm with resting heart rate ≥70 beats per minute, who are not on beta-blockers due to contraindications or already receiving maximum beta-blocker dose. Ivabradine acts by selectively inhibiting the \"funny\" channel pacemaker current (If) in the sinoatrial node in a dose-dependent fashion, resulting in a lower heart rate and thus more blood to flow to the myocardium. Although non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and beta blockers also effectively lower heart rate, they exhibit adverse events due to their negative ionotropic effects. Therefore, as ivabradine is designed as a \"pure\" heart rate-lowering drug by selectively acting on the If channels, it may offer a more favorable side effect profile due to its lower likelihood of causing serious adverse effects.\nDB09084\tBenzydamine\tsmall molecule\t[\u0027approved\u0027]\t[\u0027M01AX07\u0027, \u0027M02AA05\u0027, \u0027A01AD02\u0027, \u0027G02CC03\u0027]\t[\u0027Agents causing hyperkalemia\u0027, \u0027Agents that produce hypertension\u0027, \u0027Alimentary Tract and Metabolism\u0027, \u0027Anti-Inflammatory Agents\u0027, \u0027Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal\u0027, \u0027Antiinflammatory and Antirheumatic Products\u0027, \u0027Antiinflammatory and Antirheumatic Products, Non-Steroids\u0027, \u0027Antiinflammatory Preparations, Non-Steroids for Topical Use\u0027, \u0027Antiinflammatory Products for Vaginal Administration\u0027, \u0027Genito Urinary System and Sex Hormones\u0027, \u0027Indazoles\u0027, \u0027Mouthwashes and Gargles\u0027, \u0027Musculo-Skeletal System\u0027, \u0027Nephrotoxic agents\u0027, \u0027Pyrazoles\u0027, \u0027Stomatological Preparations\u0027, \u0027Topical Products for Joint and Muscular Pain\u0027]\tBenzydamine (also known as Tantum Verde and branded in some countries as Difflam), available as the hydrochloride salt, is a locally-acting nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with local anaesthetic and analgesic properties for pain relief and anti-inflammatory treatment of typically topical inflammatory conditions associated with the mouth, throat, or muscoskeletal locations.\r\n\r\nAlthough the indazole analogue benzydamine is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), it has various physicochemical properties and pharmacologic activities that are different from those of traditional aspirin-like NSAIDs but facilitate benzydamine\u0027s mechanism of action as an effective locally-acting NSAID with local anaesthetic and analgesic properties.

Eslicarbazepine acetate is a prodrug that is rapidly converted to eslicarbazepine, the primary active metabolite in the body. Eslicarbazepine\u0027s mechanism of action is not well understood, but it is known that it does exert anticonvulsant activity by inhibiting repeated neuronal firing and stabilizing the inactivated state of voltage-gated sodium channels, thus preventing their return to the activated state during which seizure activity can occur.\r\n\r\nEslicarbazepine acetate is marketed as Aptiom in North America and Zebinix or Exalief in Europe. It is available in 200, 400, 600, or 800mg tablets that are taken once daily, with or without food. Eslicarbazepine acetate is associated with numerous side effects including dizziness, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, aphasia, lack of concentration, psychomotor retardation, speech disturbances, ataxia, depression and hyponatremia.

Following intravenous injection, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is performed to detect the gamma ray emmitted by the decay of Technetium-99m to Technetium-99.\nDB09139\tTechnetium Tc-99m oxidronate\tsmall molecule\t[\u0027approved\u0027]\t[\u0027V09BA01\u0027]\t[\u0027Diagnostic Radiopharmaceuticals\u0027, \u0027Radioactive Diagnostic Agent\u0027, \u0027Radiopharmaceutical Activity\u0027, \u0027Skeleton\u0027, \u0027Technetium (99Mtc) Compounds\u0027]\tTechnetium Tc-99m oxidronate, also known as 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate, is a radiopharmaceutical. A radiopharmaceutical is defined as a medicinal formulation containing radioisotopes that are used in major clinical areas for diagnosis and/or therapy.[L1137] The radiopharmaceuticals based on technetium-99m are widely used for diagnostic purposes because 99mTc has a versatile chemistry which allows it to produce an extense variety of complexes with specific characteristics.[L1138] These complexes are formed by the binding of 99mTc to metal atoms of an organic molecule. The group oxidronate falls into the category of diphosphonates whose structure allows them to bind to calcium.[L1139] Thus, technetium Tc-99m oxidronate is a powerful detection tool for abnormal osteogenesis by skeletal scintigraphy.[L1140] It was developed by Mallinkrodt nuclear and FDA approved on February 18, 1981.\nDB09141\tProtamine sulfate\tbiotech\t[\u0027approved\u0027]\t[]\t[\u0027Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins\u0027, \u0027Antiheparin Agents\u0027, \u0027Coagulants\u0027, \u0027Hematologic Agents\u0027, \u0027Heparin Antagonists\u0027, \u0027Heparin Reversal Agent\u0027, \u0027Nuclear Proteins\u0027, \u0027Nucleoproteins\u0027, \u0027Proteins\u0027]\tProtamine sulfate is a drug that reverses the anticoagulant effects of heparin by binding to it.

When injected intravenously, sincalide produces a substantial reduction in gallbladder size by causing this organ to contract. The evacuation of bile that results is similar to that which occurs physiologically in response to endogenous cholecystokinin. Furthermore, sincalide stimulates pancreatic secretion of bicarbonate and enzymes.\r\n\r\nAs the product Kinevac (FDA), sincalide is used for the following indications: 1) to stimulate gallbladder contraction, as may be assessed by various methods of diagnostic imaging, or to obtain by duodenal aspiration a sample of concentrated bile for analysis of cholesterol, bile salts, phospholipids, and crystals; (2) to stimulate pancreatic secretion (especially in conjunction with secretin) prior to obtaining a duodenal aspirate for analysis of enzyme activity, composition, and cytology; (3) to accelerate the transit of a barium meal through the small bowel, thereby decreasing the time and extent of radiation associated with fluoroscopy and x-ray examination of the intestinal tract.\nDB09145\tWater\tsmall molecule\t[\u0027approved\u0027]\t[]\t[\u0027Alkalies\u0027, \u0027Anions\u0027, \u0027Diluents\u0027, \u0027EENT Drugs, Miscellaneous\u0027, \u0027Electrolytes\u0027, \u0027Hydroxides\u0027, \u0027Ions\u0027, \u0027Irrigating Solutions\u0027, \u0027Other Miscellaneous Therapeutic Agents\u0027, \u0027Oxides\u0027, \u0027Oxygen Compounds\u0027]\tWater (chemical formula: H2O) is a transparent fluid which forms the world\u0027s streams, lakes, oceans and rain, and is the major constituent of the fluids of organisms.

HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as Dasabuvir. Dasabuvir is a non-nucleoside NS5B inhibitor which binds to the palm domain of NS5B and induces a conformational change which renders the polymerase unable to elongate viral RNA [FDA Label]. The binding sites for non-nucleoside NS5B inhibitors are poorly conserved across HCV genotypes leading to the restriction of Dasabuvir\u0027s use to genotype 1 only.\r\n\r\nIn a joint recommendation published in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend Dasabuvir as first line therapy in combination with [DB09296], [DB09297], and [DB00503] for genotype 1b and with [DB00811] for genotype 1a of Hepatitis C [L852]. Dasabuvir, [DB09296], [DB09297], [DB00503], and [DB00811] are used with the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 12 weeks of therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626].\r\n\r\nDasabuvir is available as a fixed dose combination product with [DB09296], [DB09297], and [DB00503] (tradename Viekira Pak) used for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis C.

The main active ingredient in Teysuno is [DB09256], a pro-drug of [DB00544] (5-FU), which is a cytotoxic anti-metabolite drug that acts on rapidly dividing cancer cells. By mimicking a class of compounds called \"pyrimidines\" that are essential components of RNA and DNA, 5-FU is able to insert itself into strands of DNA and RNA, thereby halting the replication process necessary for continued cancer growth. \r\n\r\nGimeracil\u0027s main role within Teysuno is to prevent the breakdown of [DB00544] (5-FU), which helps to maintin high enough concentrations for sustained effect against cancer cells [L933].

This allows higher concentrations of 5-FU to be achieved with a lower dose of tegafur, thereby also reducing toxic side effects.\nDB09264\tIdarucizumab\tbiotech\t[\u0027approved\u0027]\t[\u0027V03AB37\u0027]\t[\u0027Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins\u0027, \u0027Antibodies\u0027, \u0027Antibodies, Monoclonal\u0027, \u0027Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized\u0027, \u0027Antidotes\u0027, \u0027Antihemorrhagic Agents, Miscellaneous\u0027, \u0027Blood Proteins\u0027, \u0027Globulins\u0027, \u0027Humanized Monoclonal Antibody Fragment\u0027, \u0027Immunoglobulins\u0027, \u0027Immunoproteins\u0027, \u0027Proteins\u0027, \u0027Serum Globulins\u0027]\tIdarucizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody fragment (Fab) derived from an immunoglobulin G1 isotype molecule that binds to and inactivates the oral anticoagulant dabigatran, thereby reversing its anticoagulant effect.

Cystic Fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by one of several different mutations in the gene for the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) protein, a transmembrane ion channel involved in the transport of chloride and sodium ions across cell membranes of the lungs, pancreas, and other organs. Mutations in the CFTR gene result in altered production, misfolding, or function of the CFTR protein and consequently abnormal fluid and ion transport across cell membranes [A20298, A20299]. As a result, CF patients produce a thick, sticky mucus that clogs the ducts of organs where it is produced making patients more susceptible to infections, lung damage, pancreatic insufficiency, and malnutrition [A20302]. Lumacaftor improves CF symptoms and underlying disease pathology by aiding the conformational stability of F508del-mutated CFTR proteins, preventing misfolding and resulting in increased processing and trafficking of mature protein to the cell surface. \r\n\r\nResults from clinical trials indicated that treatment with Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) results in improved lung function, reduced chance of experiencing a pulmonary exacerbation, increased weight gain, and improvements in CF symptoms [FDA Label]. This data has been heavily scrutinized, however, with clinical trials showing only modest improvements despite a hefty yearly cost of $259,000 for Orkambi [A20343]. Improvements in lung function (ppFEV1) were found to be statistically significant, but minimal, with only a 2.6-3.0% change from baseline with more than 70% of patients failing to achieve an absolute improvement of at least 5% [A20343, L936].\r\n\r\nA wide variety of CFTR mutations correlate to the Cystic Fibrosis phenotype and are associated with differing levels of disease severity. The most common mutation, affecting approximately 70% of patients with CF worldwide, is known as F508del-CFTR, or delta-F508 (ΔF508), in which a deletion in the amino acid phenylalanine at position 508 results in impaired production of the CFTR protein, thereby causing a significant reduction in the amount of ion transporter present on cell membranes [A20301]. When used in combination with [DB08820] as the fixed dose combination product Orkambi, lumacaftor is specific for the management of CF in patients with delta-F508 mutations as it acts as a protein-folding chaperone, aiding the conformational stability of the mutated CFTR protein. Consequently, lumacaftor increases successful production of CFTR ion channels and the total number of receptors available for use at the cell membrane for fluid and ion transport [A18395]. The next most common mutation, G551D, affecting 4-5% of CF patients worldwide, is characterized as a missense mutation, whereby there is sufficient amount of protein at the cell surface, but opening and closing mechanisms of the channel are altered [A17564]. Treatment of patients with G551D and other rarer missense mutations is usually managed with [DB08820] (Kalydeco), as it aids with altered gating mechanisms by potentiating channel opening probability of CFTR protein.\r\n\r\nPrior to the development of lumacaftor and [DB08820] (Kalydeco), management of CF primarily involved therapies for the control of infections, nutritional support, clearance of mucus, and management of symptoms rather than improvements in the underlying disease process. Approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration in July 2015 and by Health Canada in January 2016, Orkambi was the first combination product approved for the management of Cystic Fibrosis with delta-F508 mutations.\r\n\r\nIvacaftor is manufactured and distributed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals.\nDB09281\tMagnesium Trisilicate\tsmall molecule\t[\u0027approved\u0027]\t[]\t[\u0027Acids\u0027, \u0027Acids, Noncarboxylic\u0027, \u0027Agents that produce neuromuscular block (indirect)\u0027, \u0027Anions\u0027, \u0027Antacids\u0027, \u0027Calculi Dissolution Agent\u0027, \u0027Electrolytes\u0027, \u0027Gastric Acid Lowering Agents\u0027, \u0027Gastrointestinal Agents\u0027, \u0027Ions\u0027, \u0027Laxatives\u0027, \u0027Magnesium Compounds\u0027, \u0027Minerals\u0027, \u0027Osmotic Laxative\u0027, \u0027Oxides\u0027, \u0027Oxygen Compounds\u0027, \u0027Silicates\u0027, \u0027Silicic Acid\u0027, \u0027Silicon Compounds\u0027, \u0027Silicon Dioxide\u0027]\tMagnesium trisilicate is an inorganic compound that is used as an antacid in the treatment of peptic ulcers.\nDB09292\tSacubitril\tsmall molecule\t[\u0027approved\u0027]\t[\u0027C09DX04\u0027]\t[\u0027Acids, Acyclic\u0027, \u0027Agents causing angioedema\u0027, \u0027Amino Acids\u0027, \u0027Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins\u0027, \u0027Butyrates\u0027, \u0027Fatty Acids\u0027, \u0027Fatty Acids, Volatile\u0027, \u0027Hypotensive Agents\u0027, \u0027Lipids\u0027, \u0027Neprilysin Inhibitor\u0027, \u0027Neprilysin, antagonists \u0026 inhibitors\u0027, \u0027OATP1B1/SLCO1B1 Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027OATP1B3 inhibitors\u0027]\tSacubitril is a prodrug neprilysin inhibitor used in combination with valsartan to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with chronic heart failure (NYHA Class II-IV) and reduced ejection fraction.

ANP and BNP are released under atrial and ventricle stress, which activate downstream receptors leading to vasodilation, natriuresis and diuresis. Under normal conditions, neprilysin breaks down other vasodilating peptides and also vasoconstrictors such as angiotensin I and II, endothelin-1 and peptide amyloid beta-protein. Inhibition of neprilysin therefore leads to reduced breakdown and increased concentration of endogenous natriuretic peptides in addition to increased levels of vasoconstricting hormones such as angiotensin II. \nDB09299\tTenofovir alafenamide\tsmall molecule\t[\u0027approved\u0027]\t[\u0027J05AR19\u0027, \u0027J05AR18\u0027, \u0027J05AR17\u0027]\t[\u0027Antiinfectives for Systemic Use\u0027, \u0027Antiviral Agents\u0027, \u0027Antivirals for Systemic Use\u0027, \u0027Direct Acting Antivirals\u0027, \u0027Hepatitis B Virus Nucleoside Analog Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor\u0027, \u0027Human Immunodeficiency Virus Nucleoside Analog Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor\u0027, \u0027Nephrotoxic agents\u0027, \u0027Nucleoside and Nucleotide Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027P-glycoprotein/ABCB1 Inhibitors\u0027, \u0027P-glycoprotein/ABCB1 Substrates\u0027, \u0027Purines\u0027, \u0027Tenofovir and prodrugs\u0027]\tTenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF) is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) and a novel ester prodrug of the antiretroviral tenofovir.  Following oral administration, TAF is converted in vivo to tenofovir, an acyclic nucleoside phosphonate (nucleotide) analog of adenosine 5′-monophosphate. Tenofovir mimics normal DNA building blocks but is lacking a 3\u0027-OH molecule required for phosphodiester bond linkage. By competing with regular nucleotides for incorporation into proviral DNA and prevention of the formation of the 5\u0027 to 3\u0027 phosphodiester linkage required for DNA elongation, tenofovir causes  early chain termination and prevents proviral DNA transcription. \r\n\r\nAlthough tenofovir (available as tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) has a good safety profile and efficacy, and is currently a cornerstone of HIV antiviral treatment, its use has been associated with nephrotoxicity and reduced bone mineral density. In comparison, TAF has been shown to have improved antiviral efficacy, enhanced delivery of TFV into peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and lymphatic tissues, a higher barrier to resistance, and an improved safety profile. Improved renal safety is likely attributable to lower circulating plasma concentrations of tenofovir and therefore less exposure and damage to bone and the kidneys, where tenofovir is metabolized. Because HIV antiretroviral therapy is usually life-long, reduced toxicity and improved efficacy results in better patient outcomes and improved adherence in the long term.\r\n\r\nTenofovir alafenamide fumarate is currently available in two fixed dose combination products: Odefsey (emtricitabine, rilpivirine, and tenofovir alafenamide), and Descovy (emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide).

For people with congenital deficiency or mutation of Factor XIII, a rare bleeding disorder, exogenous replacement of this key coagulation factor is essential for management and prevention of bleeding episodes. \r\n\r\nAlso known as Fibrin Stabilizing Factor (FSF), Factor XIII is an endogenously available coagulation factor and the final enzyme within the blood coagulation cascade. Within the body, FXIII circulates as a heterotetramer composed of 2 catalytic A-subunits and 2 non-catalytic B-subunits (FXIII-A2B2) [A32363]. When activated by thrombin at the site of injury, the FXIII A2B2 pro-enzyme is cleaved resulting in activation of the catalytic A-subunit and dissociation from its carrier B-subunit. As a result, the active transglutaminase from subunit A cross-links fibrin and other proteins resulting in increased mechanical strength and resistance to fibrinolysis of the fibrin clot. This contributes to enhanced platelet and clot adhesion to injured tissue, thereby improving blood coagulation and maintenance of hemostasis [A18581].\r\n\r\nWhen supplied as the recombinant form, Coagulation Factor XIII A-Subunit (Recombinant) binds to free human FXIII B-subunit resulting in a heterotetramer (rA2B2) with a similar activity profile and half-life as the endogenously available form. In patients with congenital factor XIII A-subunit deficiency, this product (marketed as Tretten) is indicated for the routine prophylaxis of bleeding. In these patients, activated rFXIII has been shown to increase the mechanical strength of fibrin clots, slow down fibrinolysis, and to enhance platelet adhesion to the site of injury. As the half-life of endogenous Factor XIII is long (5-11 days), prophylactic therapy with the replacement of FXIII can be given every 4-6 to maintain hemostasis[A32363].  \r\n\r\nOther drug products with similar structure and function to Coagulation Factor XIII A-Subunit (Recombinant) include [DB12909], which is a purified endogenous (human) form of coagulation factor XIII. Compared to Coagulation Factor XIII A-Subunit (Recombinant), which is produced through recombinant DNA technology where the target protein is grown in yeast and then isolated, the human form is isolated from pooled human plasma.\r\n\r\nCoagulation Factor XIII A-Subunit (Recombinant) is available in the US as the commmercially available product Tretten, and in the EU as NovoThirteen. Tretten is manufactured as an intracellular, soluble protein in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) production strain containing the episomal expression vector, pD16.

This blend of nine estrogen derivatives are plant-derived forms of endogenous estrogens and contain many of the same compounds as the Conjugated Equine Estrogens (CEEs), although they are not considered to be equivalent. Available as the product Enjuvia (FDA), this combination of plant-derived estrogenic compounds is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms and vulvovaginal atrophy associated with menopause. \r\n\r\nAll estrogen products mimic the effects of endogenous estrogens in the body which are responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Estrogens act by binding to estrogen receptors on a wide variety of tissues in the body and modulating the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) through a negative feedback mechanism. Prior to menopause, the primary source of estrogen is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70-500 micrograms of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. However, once a woman stops ovulating there is a sharp decline in the production of progesterone and estradiol by the ovaries and a consequent fluctuation in LH and FSH due to a lack of feedback control. This shift in hormone production is largely responsible for many of the symptoms experienced during and after menopause and includes hot flashes and other vasomotor symptoms, painful intercourse, vaginal dryness, and vulvovaginal atrophy. These symptoms are able to be reduced by replacing many of the hormones lost during and following menopause with synthetic or naturally occurring forms, in a therapy known as Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT).\r\n\r\nPharmacologic estrogen products are available in a variety of formats. Although many of them contain several compounds in common (such as the estrogen derivatives sodium estrone sulfate and sodium equilin sulfate), they vary by their original source (such as horse-, human-, or plant-derived), and the remaining mixture of estrogenic derivatives. Conjugated Equine Estrogens (CEEs) are derived from the urine of pregnant mares and contain a blend of at least 10 estrogen derivatives.

The estrogenic substances are: sodium estrone sulfate, sodium equilin sulfate, sodium 17α-dihydroequilin sulfate, sodium 17α-estradiol sulfate, sodium 17β­ dihydroequilin sulfate, sodium 17α-dihydroequilenin sulfate, sodium 17β-dihydroequilenin sulfate, sodium equilenin sulfate, sodium 17β-estradiol sulfate, and sodium Δ8,9-dehydroestrone sulfate. This blend of ten estrogen derivatives are plant-derived forms of endogenous estrogens and contain many of the same compounds as the Conjugated Equine Estrogens (CEEs), although they are not considered to be equivalent. Available as the product Cenestin (FDA), this combination of plant-derived estrogenic compounds is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms, vulvovaginal atrophy, vaginal dryness, and paint with intercourse associated with menopause. \r\n\r\nAll estrogen products mimic the effects of endogenous estrogens in the body which are responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Estrogens act by binding to estrogen receptors on a wide variety of tissues in the body and modulating the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) through a negative feedback mechanism. Prior to menopause, the primary source of estrogen is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70-500 micrograms of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. However, once a woman stops ovulating there is a sharp decline in the production of progesterone and estradiol by the ovaries and a consequent fluctuation in LH and FSH due to a lack of feedback control. This shift in hormone production is largely responsible for many of the symptoms experienced during and after menopause and includes hot flashes and other vasomotor symptoms, painful intercourse, vaginal dryness, and vulvovaginal atrophy. These symptoms are able to be reduced by replacing many of the hormones lost during and following menopause with synthetic or naturally occurring forms, in a therapy known as Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT).\r\n\r\nPharmacologic estrogen products are available in a variety of formats. Although many of them contain several compounds in common (such as the estrogen derivatives sodium estrone sulfate and sodium equilin sulfate), they vary by their original source (such as horse-, human-, or plant-derived), and the remaining mixture of estrogenic derivatives. Conjugated Equine Estrogens (CEEs) are derived from the urine of pregnant mares and contain a blend of at least 10 estrogen derivatives.

Its use is indicated for the treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in cases where tumour EGFR expression is positive for the T790M mutation as detected by FDA-approved testing and which has progressed following therapy with a first-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Approximately 10% of patients with NSCLC have a rapid and clinically effective response to EGFR-TKIs due to the presence of specific activating EGFR mutations within the tumour cells. More specifically, deletions around the LREA motif in exon 19 and exon 21 L858R point mutations are correlated with response to therapy. \r\n\r\nDevelopment of third-generation EGFR-TKIs, such as osimertinib, has been in response to altered tumour resistance patterns following treatment and toxic side effects that impact patient quality of life. Treatment with first-generation EGFR-TKIs (gefitinib and erlotinib) has been associated with the development of resistance through activating mutations in the EGFR gene. Second-generation EGFR-TKIs (afatinib and dacomitinib) were then developed to be more potent inhibitors, although their use is associated with increased toxicity through nonspecific targeting of wild-type EGFR. In contrast, third-generation inhibitors are specific for the gate-keeper T790M mutations which increases ATP binding activity to EGFR and result in poor prognosis for late-stage disease. Furthermore, osimertinib has been shown to spare wild-type EGFR during therapy, thereby reducing non-specific binding and limiting toxicity.\nDB09331\tDaratumumab\tbiotech\t[\u0027approved\u0027]\t[]\t[\u0027Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins\u0027, \u0027Antibodies\u0027, \u0027Antibodies, Monoclonal\u0027, \u0027Antineoplastic Agents\u0027, \u0027Blood Proteins\u0027, \u0027CD38-directed Antibody Interactions\u0027, \u0027CD38-directed Cytolytic Antibody\u0027, \u0027Globulins\u0027, \u0027Immunoglobulins\u0027, \u0027Immunoproteins\u0027, \u0027Proteins\u0027, \u0027Serum Globulins\u0027]\tDaratumumab is an anti-cancer drug indicated for multiple myeloma in patients who have received at least 3 prior treatments.

It is currently used for the Urea Breath Test (UBT) and is available as a rapid diagnostic test (marketed as Pranactin-Citric) for the detection of Helicobacter pylori infections. H pylori is a common stomach bacteria that has been linked to a variety of upper gastrointestinal disorders such as gastritis, gastric and peptic ulcers, stomach cancer, and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid-tissue (MALT) lymphoma. The UBT is indicated to confirm H. pylori infection and to monitor post-treatment for its eradication. \r\n\r\nRadiolabelled urea is available in two forms as 13C and 14C. Both forms can be used within the Urea Breath Test, however some may prefer 13C as it is non-radioactive compared to 14C, which may be preferable in pregnant women and children.\r\n\r\nThe Urea Breath Test is based on the ability of the H. pylori enzyme urease to cleave urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide. As the urease enzyme is not present in mammalian cells, the presence of urease (and the products of urea cleavage) in the stomach is evidence that H. pylori bacteria are present.  To detect H. pylori, urea labeled with 13C is swallowed by the patient. If gastric urease from H. pylori is present, urea is split to form CO2 and NH3 at the interface between the gastric epithelium and lumen and 13CO2 is absorbed into the blood and exhaled in the breath.

The hormone is produced from the enterochromaffin cells in the duodenum in response to the duodenal content with the pH less than 4.5 [L1875]. The main action of secretin is to stimulate the pancreas to secrete pancreatic juice for pH regulation in the small intestines. Secretin is also responsible in body fluid homeostasis [A32276] and bile production. Although it is a gastrointestinal hormone, secretin is also considered as a neuropeptide hormone since it is also expressed in the central nervous system [A32275].\r\n\r\nPurified synthetic human secretin, also referred to as RG1068, is available as an intravenous injection under the market name ChiRhoStim ® in the U.S..

Insulin and its analogues lower blood glucose levels by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake and by preventing hepatic glucose production. Compared to endogenous insulin, this product has an added hexadecanedioic acid to lysine at the B29 position which allows for the formation of multi-hexamers. When injected subcutaneously, these multi-hexamers form a drug depot store from which monomers are slowly and continuously absorbed into the circulation. As a result, Insulin Degludec has a protracted time action profile due to the delayed absorption from subcutaneous tissue depots into the systemic circulation. Compared to available long-acting analogues such as insulin glargine and insulin detemir, which have a duration of action of 20-24 hours, insulin degludec provides a consistent level of basal insulin over 42 hours with a low peak:trough ratio. Limitations of shorter acting analogues include more frequent dosing and less stable pharmacokinetics, which may negatively impact patient adherence and glucose control, particularly nocturnal control.\r\n\r\nInsulin Degludec was approved by the FDA in September 2015 as the product Tresiba, for use in providing glycemic control to adults with diabetes mellitus.\nDB09567\tOlive oil\tsmall molecule\t[\u0027approved\u0027]\t[]\t[\u0027Biological Products\u0027, \u0027Complex Mixtures\u0027, \u0027Diet, Food, and Nutrition\u0027, \u0027Dietary Fats\u0027, \u0027Dietary Fats, Unsaturated\u0027, \u0027Fats\u0027, \u0027Fats, Unsaturated\u0027, \u0027Food\u0027, \u0027Food and Beverages\u0027, \u0027Lipid Emulsion\u0027, \u0027Lipids\u0027, \u0027Oils\u0027, \u0027Physiological Phenomena\u0027, \u0027Plant Oils\u0027, \u0027Plant Preparations\u0027]\tOil extracted from olives [L857].

While the two vaccines contain the same immunological components and provide protection against the same virus, Zostavax contains a higher dose and is used in older adults to prevent the development of shingles and post-herpetic neuralgia. \r\n\r\nFirst approved in May 2006 by the Food and Drug Administration, Zostavax was the first vaccine available for the prevention of shingles. Since October 2017, however, it has been replaced as first line therapy by Shingrix ([DB13924]), a more effective and longer lasting vaccine[L1038]. Both Varivax and Zostavax are composed of a lyophilized preparation of live, attenuated Oka/Merck strain of varicella-zoster virus. \r\n\r\nVaricella Zoster Virus (VZV) is the virus that commonly causes Chickenpox (also known as Varicella) in childhood [L1040]. Following initial infection of VZV and resolution of Chickenpox as a child, VZV then lies dormant within the dorsal root ganglion of the central nervous sytem. Decades later, when the body\u0027s immune system weakens with age, VZV is able to reactivate and descend through the nerve cells to the surface of the skin where it causes a painful blistering rash, known as shingles (or Herpes Zoster). Risk factors for developing shingles include old age, with rates increasing substantially in person\u0027s over the age of 50, low immune function or immunosuppression, psychological stress, and diabetes. Person\u0027s living with HIV or cancer, those taking immunosuppressants, and transplant recipients are particularly at risk [L1037]. \r\n\r\nOne of the most common complications associated with shingles is the development of Post-Herpetic Neuralgia (PHN), a persistant severe nerve pain that develops as a result of chronic pain from shingles lesions. PHN can last for days, months, or even years following resolution of shingles. Other complications also include bacterial infection, spread of the shingles rash to the eye (herpes zoster ophthalmicus) or ear, nerve palsies, or spread of VZV to non-immune persons via contact with varicella lesions.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous advantages to using Shingrix over Zostavax. Clinical trials for Shingrix have shown greater than 90% efficacy in adults aged 50 and older, with 89% efficacy in preventing postherpetic neuralgia in patients 70 years and older and 91% efficacy in patients 50-70 years of age. This is a significant improvement over its predecessor, Zostavax, which reduces the risk of shingles by only 51% and the risk of post-herpetic neuralgia by 67% [A31349]. Efficacy of Zostavax also wanes over time, with protection against shingles and PHN lasting only around 5 years. Efficacy for prevention of shingles is highest in patients 60-69 years old and decreases with increasing age. Furthermore, because Shingrix is an inactivated vaccine it can also be used to prevent shingles and PHN in individuals with suppressed immune systems, who are already at increased risk of developing shingles, while Zostavax, a live attenuated vaccine, is contraindicated.\nDB10319\tStreptococcus pneumoniae type 1 capsular polysaccharide antigen\tbiotech\t[\u0027approved\u0027]\t[]\t[\u0027Actively Acquired Immunity\u0027, \u0027Inactivated Pneumococcal Vaccine\u0027]\tStreptococcus pneumoniae type 1 capsular polysaccharide antigen is a vaccine that contains highly purified capsular polysaccharides from the invasive pneumococcal type 1 of *Streptococcus pneumoniae*.

The helix itself is not long enough to span the membrane but it dimerizes to form the elongated channel needed to span the whole membrane.

ADH is an endogenous pituitary hormone that has a crucial role in the control of the water content in the body. Upon release from the stimulation of increased plasma osmolarity or decreased circulating blood volume, ADH mainly acts on the cells of the distal part of the nephron and the collecting tubules in the kidney [T28]. The hormone interacts with V1, V2 or V3 receptors with differing signal cascade systems.\r\n\r\nDesmopressin displays enhanced antidiuretic potency, fewer pressor effects due to V2-selective actions, and a prolonged half-life and duration of action compared to endogenous ADH [A31661]. It has been employed clinically since 1972 and is available in various formulations including intranasal solution, intravenous solution, oral tablet and oral lyophilisate [A31662]. Desmopressin is indicated for the treatment of polyuric conditions including primary nocturnal enuresis, nocturia, and diabetes insipidus. It was also newly approved for the treatment of mild classical hemophilia and von Willebrand\u0027s disease for minor surgeries. The active ingredient in most formulations is desmopressin acetate. Nocdurna, or desmopressin acetate, was approved by the FDA on June 21st, 2018 for the treatment of nocturia due to nocturnal polyuria in adults. It is available as a sublingual tablet.\nDB00050\tCetrorelix\tsmall molecule\tapproved|investigational\tH01CC02\tAmino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins|Anti-Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormones|Decreased GnRH Secretion|Fertility Agents|Fertility Agents, Female|Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone Receptor Antagonists|Gonadotropin-releasing Hormone Antagonists|Hormone Antagonists|Hormones|Hormones, Hormone Substitutes, and Hormone Antagonists|Hypothalamic Hormones|Nerve Tissue Proteins|Neuropeptides|Oligopeptides|Peptide Hormones|Peptides|Pituitary and Hypothalamic Hormones and Analogues|Pituitary Hormone-Releasing Hormones|Proteins|Reproductive Control Agents|Systemic Hormonal Preparations, Excl.

GnRH controls another hormone that is called luteinizing hormone (LH), which is the hormone that starts ovulation during the menstrual cycle.
